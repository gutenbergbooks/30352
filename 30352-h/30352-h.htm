<h2>I</h2>
<h3>PALOMITAS</h3>
</div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around considerable
in the Western Country&ndash;&ndash;mostly
some years back&ndash;&ndash;and
I&rsquo;ve seen quite a little, one
way and another, of the folks
living there: but I can&rsquo;t really and truly
say I&rsquo;ve often come up with them nature&rsquo;s
noblemen&ndash;&ndash;all the time at it doing stunts
in natural nobility&ndash;&ndash;the story-books make
out is the chief population of them parts.
Like enough the young fellers from the
East who write such sorts of books&ndash;&ndash;having
plenty of spare time for writing, while
they&rsquo;re giving their feet a rest to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
the ache out&ndash;&ndash;do come across &rsquo;em, same as
they say they do; but I reckon the herd&rsquo;s a
small one&ndash;&ndash;and, for a fact, if you could cross
the book brand with the kind you mostly
meet on the ranges the breed would be
improved.</p>
<p>Cow-punchers and prospectors and such
don&rsquo;t look like and don&rsquo;t act like what tenderfoots
is accustomed to, and so they size
&rsquo;em up to be different all the way through.
They ain&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re just plain human nature,
same as the rest of us&ndash;&ndash;only more so,
through not being herded close in. About
the size of it is, most folks needs barbed wire
to keep &rsquo;em from straying. In a rough country&ndash;&ndash;where
laws and constables ain&rsquo;t met
with frequent&ndash;&ndash;a good-sized slice of the
population &rsquo;s apt to run wild. With them
that&rsquo;s white, it don&rsquo;t much matter. The
worst you can say against &rsquo;em is, they sometimes
do a little more shooting than seems
really needed; but such doings is apt to
have a show of reason at the bottom of &rsquo;em,
and don&rsquo;t happen often anyhow&ndash;&ndash;most being
satisfied to work off their high spirits some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
other way. With them that&rsquo;s not white,
things is different. When the Apache streak
gets on top it sends &rsquo;em along quick into
clear deviltry&ndash;&ndash;the kind that makes you
cussed just for the sake of cussedness and
not caring a damn; and it&rsquo;s them that has
give some parts of the Western Country&ndash;&ndash;like
it did New Mexico in the time I&rsquo;m talking
about, when they was bunched thick
there&ndash;&ndash;its bad name.</p>
<p>In the long run, of course, the toughs is
got rid of&ndash;&ndash;being shoved out or hung out, at
first by committees and later on in regular
shape by sheriffs and marshals&ndash;&ndash;and things
is quieted down. It&rsquo;s the everlasting truth,
though, that them kind of mavericks mostly
is a blame sight commoner in parts just
opened than the story-book kind&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s always
so calm-eyed and gentle-natured and
generous and brave. What&rsquo;s more, I reckon
they&rsquo;ll keep on being commoner, human nature
not being a thing that changes much, till
we get along to the Day of Judgment round-up&ndash;&ndash;and
the goats is cut out and corralled
for keeps.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>For certain, it was goats was right up at
the head of the procession in the Territory
in my time&ndash;&ndash;which was the time when the
railroads was a-coming in&ndash;&ndash;and in them days
things was rough. The Greasers living there
to start with wasn&rsquo;t what you might call
sand-papered; and the kind of folks found
in parts railroads has just got to, same as
I&rsquo;ve mentioned, don&rsquo;t set out to be extry
smooth. Back East they talked about the
higher civilization that was overflowing New
Mexico; but, for a cold fact, the higher
civilization that did its overflowing on that
section mostly had a sheriff on its tracks
right along up to the Missouri&ndash;&ndash;and the rest
of the way done what it blame felt like, and
used a gun.</p>
<p>Some of them native Mexicans wasn&rsquo;t bad
fighters. When they went to hacking at one
another with knives&ndash;&ndash;the way they was used
to&ndash;&ndash;they often done right well. But when
they got up against the higher civilization&ndash;&ndash;which
wasn&rsquo;t usually less &rsquo;n half drunk, and
went heeled with two Colt&rsquo;s and a Winchester&ndash;&ndash;they
found out they&rsquo;d bit off more&rsquo;n they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
could chew. Being sandy, they kept at it&ndash;&ndash;but
the civilizers was apt to have the call.
And in between times, when the two of &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;the
Greasers and the civilizers&ndash;&ndash;wasn&rsquo;t taking
the change out of each other, they both
of &rsquo;em took it out of anybody who happened
to come along.</p>
<p>Yes, sirree!&ndash;&ndash;in them days things was a
good deal at loose ends in the Territory.
When you went anywheres, if you was going
alone, you always felt you&rsquo;d better leave
word what trail you took: that is, if you was
fussy in such matters, and wanted what the
coyotes left of you brought in by your
friends and planted stylish&ndash;&ndash;with your name,
and when it happened, painted on a board.</p>
<p>This place where the track got stuck&ndash;&ndash;sticking
partly because there was trouble
with the Atchison, and partly because the
Company couldn&rsquo;t foreclose onto a year jag
any more out of the English stockholders to
build on with&ndash;&ndash;was up on a bluff right over
the Rio Grande and was called Palomitas.
Being only mostly Greasers and Indians living
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
in the Territory&ndash;&ndash;leaving out the white
folks at Santa F&eacute; and the army posts, and
the few Germans there was scattered about&ndash;&ndash;them
kind of queer-sounding names was what
was mainly used.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t never meant to be no sort of an
American town nohow, Palomitas wasn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;being
made to start with of &rsquo;dobes (which is
Mexican for houses built of mud, and mud
they was in the rainy season) spilled around
on the bluff anywheres; and when the track
come along through the middle of it the
chinks was filled in with tents and shingle-shacks
and dugouts&ndash;&ndash;all being so mixed up
and scattery you&rsquo;d a-thought somebody&rsquo;d
been packing a town through them parts in
a wagon and the load had jolted out, sort of
casual over the tail-board, and stuck where
it happened to come down. The only things
you could call houses was the deepo, and the
Forest Queen Hotel right across the track
from it, and Bill Hart&rsquo;s store. Them three
buildings was framed up respectable; with
real windows that opened, and doors such as
you could move without kicking at &rsquo;em till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
you was tired. The deepo was right down
stylish&ndash;&ndash;having a brick chimney and being
painted brown. Aside the deepo was the
tank and the windmill that pumped into it.
Seems to me at nights, sometimes, I can hear
that old windmill going around creaking and
clumpetty-clumpetting now!</p>
<p>Palomitas means &ldquo;little doves&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;but I
reckon the number of them birds about the
place was few. For about a thousand years,
more or less, it had been run on a basis of
two or three hundred Mexicans and a sprinkling
of pigs and Pueblo Indians&ndash;&ndash;the pigs was
the most respectable&ndash;&ndash;and it was allowed to
be, after the track got there, the toughest
town the Territory had to show. Santa Cruz
de la Ca&ntilde;ada, which was close to it, was said
to have took the cake for toughness before
railroad times. It was a holy terror, Santa
Cruz was! The only decent folks in it was
the French padre&ndash;&ndash;who outclassed most
saints, and hadn&rsquo;t a fly on him&ndash;&ndash;and a German
named Becker. He had the Government
forage-station, Becker had; and he
used to say he&rsquo;d had a fresh surprise every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
one of the mornings of the five years he&rsquo;d
been forage-agent&ndash;&ndash;when he woke up and
found nobody&rsquo;d knifed him in the night and
he was keeping on being alive!</p>
<p>But when the track come in, and the
higher civilization come in a-yelling with it
and spread itself, Palomitas could give points
to the Ca&ntilde;ada in cussedness all down the
line. Most of it right away was saloons and
dance-halls; and the pressure for faro accommodation
was such the padre thought he
could make money by closing down his own
monte-bank and renting. Denver Jones took
his place at fifty dollars a week, payable every
Saturday night&ndash;&ndash;and rounded on the padre
by getting back his rent-money over the table
every Sunday afternoon. He&rsquo;d a-got it back
Sunday mornings if the padre hadn&rsquo;t been
tied up mornings to his work. (He was a
native, that padre was&ndash;&ndash;and went on so
extra outrageous his own folks couldn&rsquo;t stand
him and Bishop Lamy bounced him from his
job.) Pretty much all the time there was
rumpusses; and the way they was managed
made the Mexicans&ndash;&ndash;being used, same as I&rsquo;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
said, to knives mostly&ndash;&ndash;open their eyes wide.
It seemed really to jolt &rsquo;em when they begun
to find out what a live man with his back
up could do with a gun! Occurrences was
so frequent&ndash;&ndash;before construction started up
again, and for a while after&ndash;&ndash;the new cemetery
out in the sage-brush on the mesa
come close to having as big a population as
the town.</p>
<p>What happened&ndash;&ndash;shootings, and doings of
all sorts&ndash;&ndash;mostly centred on the Forest
Queen. That was the only place that called
itself a hotel in Palomitas&ndash;&ndash;folks being able
to get some sort of victuals there, and it having
bunks in a room off the bar-room where
passers-through was give a chance to think
(by morning they was apt to think different)
they was going to have a night&rsquo;s sleep.
Kicking against what you got&ndash;&ndash;and against
the throwed-in extras you&rsquo;d a-been better
without&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t do no good. Old Tenderfoot
Sal, who kept the place, only stuck her fat
elbows out and told the kickers she done the
best she knowed how to, and she reckoned it
was as good as you could expect in them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
parts, and most was suited. If they didn&rsquo;t
like the Forest Queen Hotel, she said, they
was free to get out of it and go to one that
suited &rsquo;em better&ndash;&ndash;and as there wasn&rsquo;t none
to go to, Sal held the cards.</p>
<p>She was a corker, Sal was! By her own
account of herself, she&rsquo;d learned hotel-keeping
through being a sutler&rsquo;s wife in the war.
What sutling had had to do with it was left
to guess at, and there was opinions as to how
much her training in hoteling had done for
her; but it was allowed she&rsquo;d learned a heap
of other things&ndash;&ndash;of one sort and another&ndash;&ndash;and
her name of Tenderfoot was give her
because them fat feet of hers, in the course
of her travels, had got that hard I reckon
she wouldn&rsquo;t a-noticed it walking on red-hot
point-upwards ten-penny nails!</p>
<p>In the Forest Queen bar-room was the biggest
bank there was in town. Blister Mike&ndash;&ndash;he
was Irish, Blister was, and Sal&rsquo;s bar-keep&ndash;&ndash;had
some sort of a share in it; but it was
run by a feller who&rsquo;d got the name of Santa
F&eacute; Charley, he having had a bank over in
Santa F&eacute; afore Sal give him the offer to come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
across to Palomitas and take charge. He
was one of the blue-eyed quiet kind, Charley
was, that&rsquo;s not wholesome to monkey with;
the sort that&rsquo;s extra particular about being
polite and nice-spoken&ndash;&ndash;and never makes no
mistakes, when shooting-time comes, about
shooting to kill. When he was sober, though&ndash;&ndash;and
he had to keep sober, mostly, or his
business would a-suffered&ndash;&ndash;he wasn&rsquo;t hunting
after rumpusses: all he did was to keep
ready for &rsquo;em, and hold his end up when they
come along. He had the habit&ndash;&ndash;same as
some other of the best card sharps I&rsquo;ve met
with&ndash;&ndash;of dressing himself in black, real stylish:
wearing a long-tail coat and a boiled
shirt and white tie, and having a toney wide-brimmed
black felt hat that touched him off
fine. With them regular fire-escape clothes
on, folks was apt to take him for one; and,
when they did, he always met &rsquo;em half-way
by letting on preaching was his business&ndash;&ndash;till
he got &rsquo;em on the other side of the table
and begun to shake down what cards he
needed from up inside them black coat-sleeves.
Mostly they ended by thinking that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
maybe preaching wasn&rsquo;t just what you might
call his strongest hold.</p>
<p>It helped him in his work more&rsquo;n a little,
sometimes, dressing up that way and talking
to suit, like he knowed how to, real high-toned
talk; but I do believe for a fact he
enjoyed the dollars he got out of it less &rsquo;n he
did the fun it give him making fools of folks
by setting up rigs on &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;he truly being
the greatest hand at rigging I ever seen.
Somehow&ndash;&ndash;not having the comfort of being
able to get drunk half as often as he wanted
to&ndash;&ndash;it seemed like he give himself the let-out
he needed in them queer antics; and, for certain,
he managed &rsquo;em always so they went
with a hum. When him and the Sage-Brush
Hen played partners in rigging anybody&ndash;&ndash;as
they was apt to, the Hen being much such
another and so special friends with Charley
she&rsquo;d come on after him from Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;there
mostly was a real down spirited game!</p>
<p>She was what you might call the leading
lady in the Forest Queen dance-hall, the
Sage-Brush Hen was; and if you wanted
fun, and had to choose between her and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
basket of monkeys, all I&rsquo;ve got to say is&ndash;&ndash;nobody&rsquo;d
ever a-took the monkeys who
knowed the Hen! That girl was up to
more queer tricks than anybody of her size
and shape&ndash;&ndash;she had a powerful fine shape,
the Hen had&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve ever laid eyes on; and
she&rsquo;d run &rsquo;em in you so slick and quiet&ndash;&ndash;keeping
as demure as a cat after birds while
she was doing it&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d never suspicion anything
was happening till you found the whole
town laughing its head off at you for being
so many kinds of a fool!</p>
<p>Things wasn&rsquo;t any time what you might
call too extra quiet in Palomitas; but when
them two&ndash;&ndash;the Hen and Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;started
in together to run any racket you may bet
your life there was a first-class circus from
the word go! Grass didn&rsquo;t grow much under
their feet, either. The very minute the Hen
struck the town&ndash;&ndash;coming on after Santa F&eacute;,
same as I&rsquo;ve said, and him waiting for her
when she got there&ndash;&ndash;they went at their monkey-shining,
finishing two-handed what the
Hen had started as a lone-hand game. Right
along from then on they kept things moving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
spirited, one way and another, without much
of a let-up. And they ended off&ndash;&ndash;the day
the two of &rsquo;em, owing to circumstances, lit
out together&ndash;&ndash;by setting up on all of us what
I reckon was the best rig ever set up on anybody
anywheres since rigs was begun!</p>
<p>Palomitas was a purer town, Cherry said&ndash;&ndash;it
was him led off in the purifying&ndash;&ndash;after we
was shut of &rsquo;em, and of some others that was
fired for company; and I won&rsquo;t say he wasn&rsquo;t
right in making out it was a better town,
maybe, when we&rsquo;d got it so blame pure.
But they had their good points, the Hen and
Santa F&eacute; had&ndash;&ndash;and after they was purified
out of it some of us didn&rsquo;t never quite feel
as if the place was just the same.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>THE SAGE-BRUSH HEN</h3>
</div>
<p>The Hen blew in one day on
Hill&rsquo;s coach, coming from
Santa F&eacute;, setting up on the
box with him&ndash;&ndash;Hill run his
coach all the time the track
was stuck at Palomitas, it being quicker for
Santa F&eacute; folks going up that way to Pueblo
and Denver and Leadville than taking the
Atchison out to El Moro and changing to the
Narrow Gauge&ndash;&ndash;and she was so all over dust
that Wood sung out to him: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you
get your Sage-Brush Hen from?&rdquo; And the
name stuck.</p>
<p>More folks in Palomitas had names that
had tumbled to &rsquo;em like that than the kind
that had come regular. And even when they
sounded regular they likely wasn&rsquo;t. Regular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
names pretty often got lost coming across the
Plains in them days&ndash;&ndash;more&rsquo;n a few finding it
better, about as they got to the Missouri, to
leave behind what they&rsquo;d been called by back
East and draw something new from the pack.
Making some sort of a change was apt to be
wholesomer and often saved talk.</p>
<p>Hill said the Hen was more fun coming
across from Santa F&eacute; than anything he&rsquo;d
ever got up against; and she was all the
funnier, he said, because when he picked her
up at the Fonda she looked like as if butter
wouldn&rsquo;t melt in her mouth and started in
with her monkey-shines so sort of quiet and
demure. Along with her, waiting at the
Fonda, was an old gent with spectacles who
turned out to be a mine sharp&ndash;&ndash;one of them
fellows the Government sends out to the
Territory to write up serious in books all the
fool stories prospectors and such unload on
&rsquo;em: the kind that needs to be led, and &rsquo;ll
eat out of your hand. The Hen and the old
gent and Hill had the box-seat, the Hen in
between; and she was that particular about
her skirts climbing up, and about making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
room after she got there, that Hill said he
sized her up himself for an officer&rsquo;s wife going
East.</p>
<p>Except to say thank you, and talk polite
that way, she didn&rsquo;t open her head till they&rsquo;d
got clear of the town and begun to go slow
in that first bit of bad road among the sandhills;
and it was the old gent speaking to her&ndash;&ndash;telling
her it was a fine day, and he hoped
she liked it&ndash;&ndash;that set her stamps to working
a little then. She allowed the weather was
about what it ought to be, and said she was
much obliged and it suited her; and then she
got her tongue in behind her teeth again as
if she meant to keep it there&ndash;&ndash;till the old
gent took a fresh start by asking her if she&rsquo;d
been in the Territory long. She said polite
she hadn&rsquo;t, and was quiet for a minute.
Then she got out her pocket-handkerchief
and put it up to her eyes and said she&rsquo;d
been in it longer&rsquo;n she wanted, and was
glad she was going away. Hill said her
talking that way made him feel kind of
curious himself; but he didn&rsquo;t have no need
to ask questions&ndash;&ndash;the old gent saving him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
that trouble by going for her sort of fatherly
and pumping away at her till he got the
whole thing.</p>
<p>It come out scrappy, like as might be expected,
Hill said; and so natural-sounding he
thought he must be asleep and dreaming&ndash;&ndash;he
knowing pretty well what was going on
in the Territory, and she telling about doings
that was news to him and the kind he&rsquo;d
a-been sure to hear a lot of if they&rsquo;d ever
really come off. Hill said he wished he could
tell it all as she did&ndash;&ndash;speaking low, and ketching
her breath in the worst parts, and mopping
at her eyes with her pocket-handkerchief&ndash;&ndash;but
he couldn&rsquo;t; and all he could say about
it was it was better&rsquo;n any theatre show he&rsquo;d
ever seen. The nubs of it was, he said, that
she said her husband had taken out a troop
from Fort Wingate against the Apaches (Hill
knew blame well up there in the Navajo
country was no place to look for Apaches)
and the troop had been ambushed in a
ca&ntilde;on in the Zu&ntilde;i Mountains (which made
the story still tougher) and every man of
&rsquo;em, along with her &ldquo;dear Captain&rdquo; as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
called him, had lost his hair. &ldquo;His loved
remains are where those fierce creatures left
them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have not even the sad
solace of properly burying his precious
bones!&rdquo; And she cried.</p>
<p>The old gent was quite broke up, Hill said,
and took a-hold of her hand fatherly&ndash;&ndash;she was
a powerful fine-looking woman&ndash;&ndash;and said she
had his sympathy; and when she eased up
on her crying so she could talk she said she
was much obliged&ndash;&ndash;and felt it all the more,
she said, because he looked like a young
uncle of hers who&rsquo;d brought her up, her
father being dead, till she was married East
to her dear Captain and had come out to the
Territory with him to his dreadful doom.</p>
<p>Hill said it all went so smooth he took it
down himself at first&ndash;&ndash;but he got his wind
while she was crying, and he asked her what
her Captain&rsquo;s name was, and what was his
regiment; telling her he hadn&rsquo;t heard of
any trouble up around Wingate, and it was
news to him Apaches was in them parts.
She give him a dig in the ribs with her elbow&ndash;&ndash;as
much as to tell him he wasn&rsquo;t to ask no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
such questions&ndash;&ndash;and said back to him her
dear husband was Captain Chiswick of the
Twelfth Cavalry; and it had been a big
come down for him, she said, when he got
his commission in the Regulars, after he&rsquo;d
been a Volunteer brigadier-general in the
war.</p>
<p>Hill knowed right enough there wasn&rsquo;t
no Twelfth Cavalry nowhere, and that the
boys at Wingate was A and F troops of the
Fourth; but he ketched on to the way she
was giving it to the old gent&ndash;&ndash;and so <i>he</i> give
<i>her</i> a dig in the ribs, and said he&rsquo;d knowed
Captain Chiswick intimate, and he was as
good a fellow as ever was, and it was a
blame pity he was killed. She give him a
dig back again, at that&ndash;&ndash;and was less particular
about making room on his side.</p>
<p>The old gent took it all in, just as it come
along; and after she&rsquo;d finished up about the
Apaches killing her dear Captain he wanted
to know where she was heading for&ndash;&ndash;because
if she was going home East, he said, he was
going East himself and could give her a
father&rsquo;s care.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>She said back to him, pleasant like, that a
young man like him couldn&rsquo;t well be fathering
an old lady like her, though it was obliging
of him to offer; but, anyway, she wasn&rsquo;t
going straight back East, because she had
to wait awhile at Palomitas for a remittance
she was expecting to pay her way through&ndash;&ndash;and
she wasn&rsquo;t any too sure about it, she
said, whether she&rsquo;d get her remittance; or,
if she did get it, when it would come. Everything
bad always got down on you at once,
she said; and just as the cruel savages had
slain her dear Captain along come the news
the bank East he&rsquo;d put his money in had
broke the worst kind. Her financial difficulties
wasn&rsquo;t a patch on the trouble her
sorrowing heart was giving her, she said;
but she allowed they added what she called
pangs of bitterness to her deeper pain.</p>
<p>The old gent&ndash;&ndash;he wasn&rsquo;t a fool clean
through&ndash;&ndash;asked her what was the matter
with her Government transportation; she
having a right to transportation, being an
officer&rsquo;s widow going home. Hill said he
give her a nudge at that, as much as to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
say the old gent had her. She didn&rsquo;t faze
a bit, though. It was her Government
transportation she was waiting for, she
cracked back to him smooth and natural;
but such things had to go all the way to
Washington to be settled, she said, and
then come West again&ndash;&ndash;Hill said he &rsquo;most
snickered out at that&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;d known
cases when red-tape had got in the way and
transportation hadn&rsquo;t been allowed at all.
Then she sighed terrible, and said it might
be a long, long while before she could get
home again to her little boy&ndash;&ndash;who was all
there was left her in the world. Her little
Willy was being took care of by his grandmother,
she said, and he was just his father&rsquo;s
own handsome self over again&ndash;&ndash;and she got
out her pocket-handkerchief and jammed it
up to her eyes.</p>

&ldquo;HER LEFT HAND WAS LAYING IN HER LAP,<br />
AND THE OLD GENT GOT A-HOLD OF IT&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>Her left hand was laying in her lap, sort of
casual, and the old gent got a-hold of it and
said he didn&rsquo;t know how to tell her how sorry
he was for her. Talking from behind her
pocket-handkerchief, she said such sympathy
was precious; and then she went on, kind of
pitiful, saying she s&rsquo;posed her little Willy&rsquo;d
have forgot all about her before she&rsquo;d get
back to him&ndash;&ndash;and she cried some more. Hill
said she done it so well he was half took in
himself for a minute, and felt so bad he went
to licking and swearing at his mules.</p>
<p>After a while she took a brace&ndash;&ndash;getting
down her pocket-handkerchief, and calling
in the hand the old gent was a-holding&ndash;&ndash;and
said she must be brave, like her dear Captain&rsquo;d
always been, so he&rsquo;d see when he
was a-looking at her from heaven she was
doing the square thing. And as to having
to wait around before she went East, she
said, in one way it didn&rsquo;t make any matter&ndash;&ndash;seeing
she&rsquo;d be well cared for and comfortable
at Palomitas staying in the house of the
Baptist minister, who&rsquo;d married her aunt.</p>
<p>Hill said when she went to talking about
Baptist ministers and aunts in Palomitas he
shook so laughing inside he most fell off the
box. Except the Mexican padre who belonged
there&ndash;&ndash;the one I&rsquo;ve spoke of that
made a record, and Bishop Lamy had to
bounce&ndash;&ndash;and sometimes the French ones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
from San Juan and the Ca&ntilde;ada, who was
straight as strings, there wasn&rsquo;t a fire-escape
ever showed himself in Palomitas; and as
to the ladies of the town&ndash;&ndash;well, the ladies
wasn&rsquo;t just what you&rsquo;d call the aunt kind.
It&rsquo;s a cold fact that Palomitas, that year
when the end of the track stuck there, was
the cussedest town, same as I&rsquo;ve said it was,
in the whole Territory&ndash;&ndash;and so it was no
more&rsquo;n natural Hill should pretty near bust
himself trying to hold in his laughing when
the Hen took to talking so off-hand about
Palomitas and Baptist ministers and aunts.
She felt how he was shaking, and jammed
him hard with her elbow to keep him
from letting his laugh out and giving her
away.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Hill said they&rsquo;d got along to Pojuaque by
the time the Hen had finished telling about
herself, and the fix she was in because she
had to wait along with her aunt in Palomitas
till her transportation come from Washington&ndash;&ndash;and
she just sick to get East and grab her
little Willy in her arms. And the old gent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
was that interested in it all, Hill said, it was
a sight to see how he went on.</p>
<p>At Pojuaque the coach always made a
noon stop, and the team was changed and
the passengers got dinner at old man Bouquet&rsquo;s.
He was a Frenchman, old man
Bouquet was; but he&rsquo;d been in the Territory
from &rsquo;way back, and he&rsquo;d got a nice garden
behind his house and things fixed up French
style. His strongest hold was his wine-making.
He made a first-class drink, as drinks
of that sort go; and, for its kind, it was
pretty strong. As his cooking was first-class
too, Hill&rsquo;s passengers&ndash;&ndash;and the other folks
that stopped for grub there&ndash;&ndash;always wanted
to make a good long halt.</p>
<p>Hill said it turned out the old gent knowed
how to talk French, and that made old man
Bouquet extra obliging&ndash;&ndash;and he set up a
rattling good dinner and fetched out some of
the wine he said he was in the habit of keeping
for his own drinking, seeing he&rsquo;d got
somebody in the house for once who really
could tell the difference between good and
bad. He fixed up a table out in the garden&ndash;&ndash;aside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
of that queer tree, all growed together,
he thought so much of&ndash;&ndash;and set
down with &rsquo;em himself; and Hill said it was
one of the pleasantest parties he&rsquo;d ever been
at in all his born days.</p>
<p>The Hen and the old gent got friendlier
and friendlier&ndash;&ndash;she being more cheerful when
she&rsquo;d been setting at table a while, and getting
to talking so comical she kept &rsquo;em all
on a full laugh. Now and then, though,
she&rsquo;d pull up sudden and kind of back away&ndash;&ndash;making
out she didn&rsquo;t want it to show so
much&ndash;&ndash;and get her pocket-handkerchief to
her eyes and snuffle; and then she&rsquo;d pull
herself together sort of conspicuous, and say
she didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the party, but she
couldn&rsquo;t help thinking how long it was likely
to be before she&rsquo;d see her little boy. And
then the old gent would say that such tender
motherliness did her credit, and hers was a
sweet nature, and he&rsquo;d hold her hand till she
took it away.</p>
<p>Hill said the time passed so pleasant he
forgot how it was going, and when he happened
to think to look at his watch he found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
he&rsquo;d have to everlastingly hustle his mules
to get over to Palomitas in time to ketch
the Denver train. He went off in a tearing
hurry to hitch up, and old man Bouquet
went along to help him&ndash;&ndash;the old gent saying
he guessed he and Mrs. Chiswick would stay
setting where they was, it being cool and
comfortable in the garden, till the team was
put to. They set so solid, Hill said, they
didn&rsquo;t hear him when he sung out to &rsquo;em he
was ready; and he said he let his mouth go
wide open and yelled like hell. (Hill always
talked that careless way. He didn&rsquo;t mean
no harm by it. He said it was just a habit
he&rsquo;d got into driving mules.) They not coming,
he went to hurry &rsquo;em, he said&ndash;&ndash;and as he
come up behind &rsquo;em the Hen was stuffing
something into her frock, and the old gent
was saying: &ldquo;I want you to get quickly to
your dear infant, my daughter. You can return
at your convenience my trifling loan.
And now I will give you a fatherly kiss&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t, Hill said&ndash;&ndash;because the Hen
heard Hill&rsquo;s boots on the gravel and faced
round so quick she spoiled his chance. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
seemed a little jolted, Hill said; but the Hen
was so cool, and talked so pleasant and natural
about what a nice dinner they&rsquo;d been
having, and what a fine afternoon it was, he
braced up and got to talking easy too.</p>
<p>Then they all broke for the coach, and got
away across the Tesuque River and on
through the sandhills&ndash;&ndash;with Hill cutting
away at his mules and using words to &rsquo;em fit
to blister their hides off&ndash;&ndash;and when they
fetched the Ca&ntilde;ada they&rsquo;d about ketched up
again to schedule time. After the Mexican
who kept the Santa Cruz post-office had
made the mess he always did with the mail
matter, and had got the cussing he always
got from Hill for doing it, they started off
again&ndash;&ndash;coming slow through that bit of
extra heavy road along by the Rio Grande,
but getting to the deepo at Palomitas all
serene to ketch the Denver train.</p>
<p>All the way over from Pojuaque, Hill said,
he could see out of the corner of his eye the
old gent was nudging up to the Hen with his
shoulder, friendly and sociable; and he said
he noticed the Hen was a good deal less particular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
about making room. The old gent
flushed up and got into a regular temper,
Hill said, when Wood sung out as they
pulled in to the deepo platform: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d
you get your Sage-Brush Hen from?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
that way give her what stuck fast for her
name.</p>
<p>As it turned out, they might a-kept on
a-hashing as long as they&rsquo;d a mind to at
Pojuaque; and Hill might a-let his mules
take it easy, without tiring himself swearing
at &rsquo;em, on a dead walk&ndash;&ndash;there being a wash-out
in the Comanche Ca&ntilde;on, up above the
Embudo, that held the train. It wasn&rsquo;t
much of a wash-out, the conductor said; but
he said he guessed all hands likely&rsquo;d be more
comfortable waiting at Palomitas, where
there was things doing, than they would be
setting still in the ca&ntilde;on while the track-gang
finished their job&ndash;&ndash;and he said he reckoned
the train wouldn&rsquo;t start for about three
hours.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Hen and the old gent was standing
on the deepo platform, where they&rsquo;d landed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
from the coach; and Hill said as he was
taking his mails across to the express-car he
heard him asking her once more if she hadn&rsquo;t
better come right along East to her lonely
babe; and promising to take a father&rsquo;s care
of her all the way. The Hen seemed to be
in two minds about it for a minute, Hill said,
and then she thanked him, sweet as sugar,
for his goodness to her in her time of trouble;
and told him it would be a real comfort to
go East with such a kind escort to take care
of her&ndash;&ndash;but she said it wouldn&rsquo;t work, because
she was expected in Palomitas, and
not stopping there would be disappointing
to her dear uncle and aunt.</p>
<p>It was after sundown and getting duskish,
while they was talking; and she said she
must be getting along. The old gent said
he&rsquo;d go with her; but she said he mustn&rsquo;t
think of it, as it was only a step to the parsonage
and she knew the way. While he
was keeping on telling her she really must
let him see her safe with her relatives, up
come Santa F&eacute; Charley&ndash;&ndash;and Charley sung
out: &ldquo;Hello, old girl. So you&rsquo;ve got here!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
I was looking for you on the coach, and I
thought you hadn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill said he begun to shake all over with
laughing; being sure&ndash;&ndash;for all Charley in his
black clothes and white tie looked so toney&ndash;&ndash;it
would be a dead give away for her. But
he said she only give a little jump when
Santa F&eacute; sung out to her, and didn&rsquo;t turn a
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Uncle Charley, I <i>am</i> so glad to see
you!&rdquo; she said easy and pleasant; and then
round she come to the old gent, and said as
smooth as butter to him: &ldquo;This is my uncle,
the Baptist minister, sir, come to take me to
the parsonage to my dear aunt. It&rsquo;s almost
funny to have so young an uncle! Aunt&rsquo;s
young too&ndash;&ndash;you see, grandfather married a
second time. We&rsquo;re more like sister and
brother&ndash;&ndash;being so near of an age; and he
always will talk to me free and easy, like he
always did&ndash;&ndash;though I tell him now he&rsquo;s a
minister it don&rsquo;t sound well.&rdquo; And then she
whipped round to Charley, so quick he hadn&rsquo;t
time to get a word in edgeways, and said to
him: &ldquo;I hope Aunt Jane&rsquo;s well, and didn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
have to go up to Denver&ndash;&ndash;as she said she
might in her last letter&ndash;&ndash;to look after Cousin
Mary. And I do hope you&rsquo;ve finished the
painting she said was going on at the parsonage&ndash;&ndash;so
you can take me in there till my
transportation comes and I can start East.
This kind gentleman, who&rsquo;s going up on to-night&rsquo;s
train, has been offering&ndash;&ndash;and it&rsquo;s just
as good of him, even if I can&rsquo;t go&ndash;&ndash;to escort
me home to my dear baby; and he&rsquo;s been
giving me in the sweetest way his sympathy
over my dear husband Captain Chiswick&rsquo;s
loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill said he never knowed anybody take
cards as quick as Santa F&eacute; took the cards
the Hen was giving him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy
to meet you, sir,&rdquo; he said to the old gent;
&ldquo;and most grateful to you for your kindness
to my poor niece Rachel in her distress. We
have been sorrowing over her during Captain
Chiswick&rsquo;s long and painful illness&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Captain had been sick for three
months, and got up out of his bed to go and
be killed with his men by those dreadful
Apaches,&rdquo; the Hen cut in.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;and when the news came of the massacre,&rdquo;
Charley went right on, as cool as an
iced drink, &ldquo;our hearts almost broke for her.
Captain Chiswick was a splendid gentleman,
sir; one of the finest officers ever sent out to
this Territory. His loss is a bad thing for
the service; but it is a worse thing for my
poor niece&ndash;&ndash;left forsaken along with her
sweet babes. They are noble children, sir;
worthy of their noble sire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Charley!&rdquo; said the Hen.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get my letter telling you my
little Jane died of croup? I&rsquo;ve only my little
Willy, now!&rdquo; And she kind of gagged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor child. My poor child!&rdquo; said
Santa F&eacute;. &ldquo;I did not know that death had
winged a double dart at you like that&ndash;&ndash;your
letter never came.&rdquo; And then he said to
the old gent: &ldquo;The mail service in this Territory,
sir, is a disgrace to the country. The
Government ought to be ashamed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill said while they was giving it and taking
it that way he most choked&ndash;&ndash;particular
as the old gent just gulped it all down whole.</p>
<p>Hill said the three of &rsquo;em was sort of quiet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and sorrowful for a minute, and then Santa
F&eacute; said: &ldquo;It is too bad, Rachel, but your
Aunt Jane did have to go up to Denver
yesterday&ndash;&ndash;a despatch came saying Cousin
Mary&rsquo;s taken worse. And the parsonage is
in such a mess still with the painters that
I&rsquo;ve moved over to the Forest Queen Hotel.
But you can come there too&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s kept by an
officer&rsquo;s widow, you know, and is most quiet
and respectable&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;ll be almost as
comfortable waiting there till your transportation
comes along as you would be if I
could take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill said hearing the Forest Queen talked
about as quiet and respectable, and Santa
F&eacute;&rsquo;s so sort of off-hand making an officer&rsquo;s
widow out of old Tenderfoot Sal, set him to
shaking at such a rate he had to get to where
there was a keg of railroad spikes and set
down on it and hold his sides with both
hands.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; turned to the old gent, Hill said&ndash;&ndash;talking
as polite as a Pullman conductor&ndash;&ndash;and
told him since he&rsquo;d been so kind to his
unhappy niece he hoped he&rsquo;d come along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
with &rsquo;em to the hotel too&ndash;&ndash;where he&rsquo;d be
more comfortable, Santa F&eacute; said, getting
something to eat and drink than he would
be kicking around the deepo waiting till
they&rsquo;d filled in the wash-out and the train
could start.</p>
<p>Hill said the Hen give Santa F&eacute; a queer
sort of look at that, as much as to ask him if
he was dead sure he had the cards for that
lead. Santa F&eacute; give her a look back again,
as much as to say he knew what was and
what wasn&rsquo;t on the table; and then he went
on to the old gent, speaking pleasant, telling
him likely it might be a little bit noisy over
at the hotel&ndash;&ndash;doing her best, he said, Mrs.
Major Rogers couldn&rsquo;t help having noise
sometimes, things being so rough and tumble
out there on the frontier; but he had a
private room for his study, where he wrote
his sermons, he said, and got into it by a
side door&ndash;&ndash;and so he guessed things wouldn&rsquo;t
be too bad.</p>
<p>That seemed to make the Hen easy, Hill
said; and away the three of &rsquo;em went together
to the Forest Queen. Hill knowed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
was straight enough about the private room
and the side door&ndash;&ndash;Santa F&eacute; had it to do
business in for himself, on the quiet, when he
didn&rsquo;t have to deal; and Hill&rsquo;d known of a
good many folks who&rsquo;d gone in that private
room by that side door and hadn&rsquo;t come out
again till Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;d scooped their pile. But
it wasn&rsquo;t no business of his, he said; and he
said he was glad to get shut of &rsquo;em so he
might have a chance to let out the laughing
that fairly was hurting his insides.</p>
<p>As they was going away from the deepo,
Hill said, he heard Santa F&eacute; telling the old
gent he was sorry it was getting so dark&ndash;&ndash;as
he&rsquo;d like to take him round so he could see
the parsonage, and the new church they&rsquo;d
just finished building and was going to put
an organ in as soon as they&rsquo;d raised more
funds; but it wasn&rsquo;t worth while going out
of their way, he said, because they wouldn&rsquo;t
show to no sort of advantage with the light
so bad. As the only church in Palomitas was
the Mexican mud one about two hundred
years old, and as the nearest thing to a parsonage
was the Padre&rsquo;s house that Denver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Jones had rented and had his faro-bank in,
Hill said he guessed Charley acted sensible
in not trying to show the old gent around
that part of the town.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Hill said after he&rsquo;d got his supper he
thought he&rsquo;d come down to the deepo and
sort of wait around there; on the chance
he&rsquo;d ketch on&ndash;&ndash;when the old gent come over
to the train&ndash;&ndash;to what Santa F&eacute; and the Hen&rsquo;d
been putting up on him. Sure enough, he
did.</p>
<p>Along about ten o&rsquo;clock a starting-order
come down&ndash;&ndash;the track-gang by that time
having the wash-out so near fixed it would
be fit by the time the train got there to go
across; and Wood&ndash;&ndash;he was the agent, Wood
was&ndash;&ndash;sent word over to the Forest Queen to
the old gent, who was the only Pullman passenger,
he&rsquo;d better be coming along.</p>
<p>In five minutes or so he showed up. He
wasn&rsquo;t in the best shape, Hill said, and
Santa F&eacute; and the Hen each of &rsquo;em was
giving him an arm; though what he seemed
to need more&rsquo;n arms, Hill said, was legs&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
ones he had, judging from the way he
couldn&rsquo;t manage &rsquo;em, not being in first-class
order and working bad. But he didn&rsquo;t make
no exhibition of himself, and talked right
enough&ndash;&ndash;only he spoke sort of short and
scrappy&ndash;&ndash;and the three of &rsquo;em was as friendly
together as friendly could be. Hill said
he didn&rsquo;t think it was any hurt to listen,
things being the way they was, and he edged
up close to &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;while they stood waiting
for the porter to light up the Pullman&ndash;&ndash;and
though he couldn&rsquo;t quite make sense of all
they was saying he did get on to enough of
it to size up pretty close how they&rsquo;d put the
old gent through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although it is for my struggling church,
a weak blade of grass in the desert,&rdquo; Santa
F&eacute; was saying when Hill got the range of &rsquo;em,
&ldquo;I cannot but regret having taken from you
your splendid contribution to our parish fund
in so unusual, I might almost say in so unseemly,
a way. That I have returned to
you a sufficient sum to enable you to prosecute
your journey to its conclusion places
you under no obligation to me. Indeed, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
could not have done less&ndash;&ndash;considering the
very liberal loan that you have made to my
poor niece to enable her to return quickly to
her helpless babe. As I hardly need tell you,
that loan will be returned promptly&ndash;&ndash;as soon
as Mrs. Captain Chiswick gets East and is
able to disentangle her affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it will,&rdquo; the Hen put in. &ldquo;My
generous benefactor shall be squared with if
I have to sell my clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t think of such a thing. Catch
cold,&rdquo; the old gent said. &ldquo;Pleasure&rsquo;s all
mine to assist such noble a woman in her
unmerited distress. And now I shall have
happiness, and same time sorrow, to give
her fatherly kiss for farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hen edged away a little, Hill said,
and Santa F&eacute; shortened his grip a little on
the old gent&rsquo;s arm&ndash;&ndash;so his fatherly kissing
missed fire. But he didn&rsquo;t seem to notice,
and said to Santa F&eacute;: &ldquo;Never knew a minister
know cards like you. Wonderful! And
wonderful luck what you held. Played cards
a good deal myself. Never could play like
you!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>Santa F&eacute; steadied the old gent, Hill said,
and said to him in a kind of explaining way:
&ldquo;As I told you, my dear sir, in my wild
college days&ndash;&ndash;before I got light on my sinful
path and headed for the ministry&ndash;&ndash;I was
reckoned something out of the common as a
card-player; and what the profane call luck
used to be with me all the time. Of course,
since I humbly&ndash;&ndash;but, I trust, helpfully&ndash;&ndash;took
to being a worker in the vineyard, I have
not touched those devil&rsquo;s picture-books; nor
should I have touched them to-night but for
my hope that a little game would help to
while away your time of tedious waiting.
As for playing for money, that would have
been quite impossible had it not been for my
niece&rsquo;s suggestion that my winnings&ndash;&ndash;in case
such came to me&ndash;&ndash;should be added to our
meagre parish fund. I trust that I have not
done wrong in yielding to my impulse. At
least I have to sustain me the knowledge
that if you, my dear sir, are somewhat the
worse, my impoverished church is much the
better for our friendly game of chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill said hearing Santa F&eacute; Charley talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
about chance in any game where he had the
dealing was so funny it was better&rsquo;n going
to the circus. But the old gent took it right
enough&ndash;&ndash;and the Hen added on: &ldquo;Yes,
Uncle Charley can get the organ he&rsquo;s been
wanting so badly for his church, now. And
I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll all think of how we owe its
sweet music to you every time we hear it
played!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and she edged up to him again,
so he could hold her hand. &ldquo;It must make
you very, very happy, sir,&rdquo; she kept on,
speaking kind of low and gentle, but not
coming as close as he wanted her, &ldquo;to go
about the world doing such generous-hearted
good deeds! I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d like to thank you
enough&ndash;&ndash;only there aren&rsquo;t any fit words to
thank you in&ndash;&ndash;for your noble-hearted generous
goodness to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gent hauled away on her hand, Hill
said, trying to get her closer, and said back to
her: &ldquo;Words quite unnecessary. Old man&rsquo;s
heart filled with pleasure obliging such dear
child. Never mind about words. Accept
old man&rsquo;s fatherly kiss, like daughter, for
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>But he missed it that time too, Hill said&ndash;&ndash;and
Hill said, speaking in his careless cuss-word
way, it was pretty damn rough on him
what poor luck in fatherly kisses he seemed
to have&ndash;&ndash;because just then the train conductor
swung his lantern and sung out:
&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That ended things. Before the old gent
knowed what had got him, Santa F&eacute; and
the Hen had boosted him up the steps onto
the platform of the Pullman&ndash;&ndash;where the Pullman
conductor got a grip on him just in time
to save him from spilling&ndash;&ndash;and then the train
pulled out: with the Pullman conductor keeping
him steady, and he throwing back good-bye
kisses to the Hen with both hands.</p>
<p>Hill said the Hen and Santa F&eacute; kept quiet
till the hind-lights showed beyond the end
of the deepo platform: and then the Hen
grabbed Santa F&eacute; round the neck and just
hung onto him&ndash;&ndash;so full of laugh she was limp&ndash;&ndash;while
they both roared. And Hill said he
roared too. It was the most comical bit of
business, he said, he&rsquo;d tumbled to in all his
born days!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t till the train got clean round the
curve above the station, Hill said, that
Charley and the Hen could pull &rsquo;emselves
together so they could talk. Then the Hen
let a-go of Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s neck and said comical&ndash;&ndash;speaking
kind of precise and toney, like as if
she was an officer&rsquo;s wife sure enough: &ldquo;You
had better return to your study, dear Uncle
Charley, and finish writing that sermon you
said we&rsquo;d interrupted you in that was about
caring for the sheep as well as the lambs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they went off together yelling,
Hill said, over to the Forest Queen.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>HART&rsquo;S NEPHEW&rsquo;S HOLD-UP</h3>
</div>
<p>Hill always said he counted on
coming into Palomitas some
day on one of his mules bareback&ndash;&ndash;leaving
the other five
dead or stampeded, and the
coach stalled somewhere&ndash;&ndash;and bringing his
hair only because road-agents hadn&rsquo;t no
use for hair and his wasn&rsquo;t easy to get anyhow,
he being so bald on top there wasn&rsquo;t
nothing to ketch a-hold of if anybody wanted
to lift what little there was along the sides.
Of course that was just Hill&rsquo;s comical way
of putting it; but back of his fool talk there
was hard sense&ndash;&ndash;as there was apt to be back
of Hill&rsquo;s talk every time. He knew blame
well what he was up against, Hill did; and
if he hadn&rsquo;t been more&rsquo;n extra sandy he
never could a-held down his job.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>Till Hill started his coach up, the only
way to get across to Santa F&eacute; from Palomitas
was to go a-horseback or walk. Both ways
was unhealthy; and the coach, being pretty
near as liable to hold-ups, wasn&rsquo;t much
healthier. It had to go slow, the coach had&ndash;&ndash;that
was a powerful mean road after you
left Pojuaque and got in among the sandhills&ndash;&ndash;and
you never was sure when some
of them bunches of scrub-cedar wasn&rsquo;t going
to wake up and take to pumping lead into
you. Only a nervy man, like Hill was, ever
could have took the contract; and Hill said
he got so rattled sometimes&ndash;&ndash;when it happened
he hadn&rsquo;t no passengers and was going
it alone in among them sandhills&ndash;&ndash;he
guessed it was only because he had so little
hair to turn anything it didn&rsquo;t turn gray.</p>
<p>Hill slept at the Forest Queen, the nights
he was in Palomitas&ndash;&ndash;he drove one way
one day and the other way the next&ndash;&ndash;and
the boys made things cheerfuller for him by
all the time rigging him about the poor show
he had for sticking long at his job. He&rsquo;d
look well, they said, a-laying out there in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
the sage-brush plugged full of lead waiting
for his friends to call for him; and they asked
him how he thought he&rsquo;d enjoy being a free-lunch
counter for coyotes; and they told
him he&rsquo;d better write down on a piece of
paper anything he&rsquo;d like particular to have
painted on the board&ndash;&ndash;and they just generally
devilled him all round. Hill didn&rsquo;t
mind the fool talk they give him&ndash;&ndash;he always
was a good-natured fellow, Hill was&ndash;&ndash;and he
mostly managed to hit back at &rsquo;em, one way
or another, so they&rsquo;d come out about even
and end up with drinks for all hands.</p>
<p>The only one who really didn&rsquo;t like that
sort of talk, and always kicked when the
boys started in on it, was the Sage-Brush
Hen. She said it was a mean shame to
make a joke about a thing like that, seeing
there wasn&rsquo;t a day when it mightn&rsquo;t happen;
and it wasn&rsquo;t like an ordinary shooting-match,
she said, that come along in the
regular way and both of you took your
chances; and sometimes she&rsquo;d get that mad
and worried she&rsquo;d go right smack out of the
room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>You see, the Hen always thought a heap of
Hill&ndash;&ndash;they having got to be such friends
together that first day when he brought her
over to Palomitas on the coach and helped
her put up her rig on the old gent from
Washington; and, back of her liking Hill
specially, she really was about as good-natured
a woman as ever lived. Except Hart&rsquo;s
nephew&ndash;&ndash;she did just hate Hart&rsquo;s nephew,
who was a chump if ever there was one&ndash;&ndash;she
always was as pleasant as pie with everybody;
and if any of the boys was hurt&ndash;&ndash;like
when Denver Jones got that jag in his
shoulder rumpussing with Santa F&eacute; Charley;
and she more friends with Charley, of course,
than with anybody else&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;d turn right in
and help all she knowed how.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a cold fact, for all her being so
good-natured and obliging, that wherever
that Hen was there was a circus. It was on
her account Charley and Denver had their
little difficulty; and, one way and another,
there was more shooting-scrapes about her
than about all the other girls put together
in all the dance-halls in town. Why, it got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
to be so that one corner of the new cemetery
out on the mesa was called her private lot.
It wasn&rsquo;t her fault, she always said; and, in
one way, it wasn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;she always being willing
to be sociable and friendly all round. But,
all the same, wherever that Sage-Brush Hen
was, there was dead sure to be an all-right
cyclone.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>One night when the boys at the Forest
Queen was rigging Hill worse&rsquo;n usual, and the
Hen all the time getting madder and madder,
Santa F&eacute; Charley come into the game himself.
Knowing how down the Hen was on such
doings he usually didn&rsquo;t. I guess he and
she&rsquo;d been having some sort of a ruction
that day, and he wanted to get even with
her. Anyhow, in he come&ndash;&ndash;and the way he
played his hand just got the Hen right up
on her ear.</p>
<p>What Charley did was to start a thirty-day
pool on Hill as to when it would happen.
Chances was a dollar apiece&ndash;&ndash;the dates for
thirty days ahead being written on bits of
paper, and the bits crumpled up and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
into a hat, and you took one&ndash;&ndash;and the pool
went to whoever got the right date, with
consolation stakes to whoever got the day
before and the day after. Charley made a
comical speech, after the drawing, telling
the boys it was what you might call a quick
return investment, and he guessed all of
&rsquo;em had got left who&rsquo;d drawed dates more&rsquo;n
a week away. Hill took it all right, same
as usual; and just to show &rsquo;em he didn&rsquo;t
bear no malice he bought a chance himself.
He was one of the best-natured fellows
ever got born, Hill was. There wasn&rsquo;t
no Apache in him nowhere. He was white
all the way through. So he bought his
chance, that way, and then he give it to
the Hen&ndash;&ndash;telling her if he pulled the pot
himself it wouldn&rsquo;t be much good to him,
and saying he hoped she&rsquo;d get it if anybody
did, and asking her&ndash;&ndash;if she did get
it&ndash;&ndash;to have some extry nice touches put on
the board.</p>
<p>Well, will you believe it? When Hill give
that Hen his chance she begun to cry over
it! She knew it wouldn&rsquo;t do to cry hard&ndash;&ndash;seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
what a mess it would make with her
color when the tears got running&ndash;&ndash;and so she
pulled herself up quick and mopped her eyes
dry with her pocket-handkerchief. And then
she let out with all four legs at once, like a
Colorado mule, and everlastingly gave it to
all hands! It was just like the Hen, being so
good-hearted, and thinking so much of Hill,
to fire up like that about Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s pool on
when he&rsquo;d get his medicine; and all the boys
knowed that beside the address she was
making to the whole congregation Santa F&eacute;
was going to get another, and a worse one,
when she had him off where she could play
out to him a lone hand. But the boys
didn&rsquo;t mind the jawing she give &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;except
they was a little ashamed, knowing putting
such a rig on Hill was a mean thing to do&ndash;&ndash;and
I guess the whole business would have
ended right there (only for the dressing-down
Santa F&eacute; was to get later) if Hart&rsquo;s nephew
hadn&rsquo;t taken it into his head to chip in&ndash;&ndash;being
drunker&rsquo;n usual, and a fool anyway&ndash;&ndash;and
so started what turned out to be a fresh game.</p>
<p>I do suppose Hart&rsquo;s nephew was about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
the meanest ever got born. Bill Hart was
a good enough fellow himself, and how he
ever come to have such a God-forsaken
chump for a nephew was more&rsquo;n anybody
could tell. Things must have been powerful
bad, I reckon, on his mother&rsquo;s side. He
was one of the blowing kind, with nothing
behind his blow; and his feet was that tender
they wasn&rsquo;t fit to walk on anything harder&rsquo;n
fresh mush. The boys all the time was putting
up rigs on him; and he&rsquo;d go around
talking so big about what he meant to do to
get even with &rsquo;em you&rsquo;d think he was going
to clean out the whole town. But he took
mighty good care to do his tall talking promiscuous:
after making the mistake of trying
it once on a little man he thought he
could manage&ndash;&ndash;a real peaceable little feller
that looked like he wouldn&rsquo;t stand up to a
kitten&ndash;&ndash;and getting his nose and his mouth
and his eyes all mashed into one. The little
man apologized to the rest for doing it that
way, saying he&rsquo;d a-been ashamed of himself
all the rest of his life if he&rsquo;d gone for a thing
like that with his gun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>Well, it was this Hart&rsquo;s nephew&ndash;&ndash;like
enough he had some sort of a name that
belonged to him, but he wasn&rsquo;t worth the
trouble of finding out what it was&ndash;&ndash;who
chipped in when the Hen took to her tirading,
and so give things a new turn. Standing
up staggery, and talking in his drunk fool
way, he told her the road across to Santa
F&eacute; was as safe as a Sunday-school; and he
said he&rsquo;d be glad to be in Hill&rsquo;s boots and
drive that coach himself, seeing what an
interest she took in stage-drivers; and he
asked her, sort of nasty, how she managed
to get along for company when Hill was at
the other end of his run. Hart&rsquo;s nephew was
drunker&rsquo;n usual that night, same as I&rsquo;ve said,
or even he&rsquo;d a-knowed he&rsquo;d likely get into
trouble talking that way to the Hen.</p>
<p>For about a minute things looked real
serious. The Hen straightened right up,
and on the back of her neck&ndash;&ndash;where it
showed, she not being fixed red there to
start with&ndash;&ndash;she got as red as canned tomatoes;
and some of the boys moved a little,
sort of uneasy; and Santa F&eacute; reached out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
over the piles of chips for his gun. He didn&rsquo;t
get it, because the Hen saw what he was
doing and stopped him by looking at him
quick&ndash;&ndash;and knowing what Charley was when
it come to shooting, you&rsquo;ll know the Hen
sent that look at him about as fast as looks
can go! The game had stopped right there;
and it was so quiet in the room you&rsquo;d a-thought
the snoring of the two drunks asleep
on benches in one corner was a thunder-storm
coming down the ca&ntilde;on!</p>
<p>Of course what we all expected the Hen
to do was to wipe up the floor with Hart&rsquo;s
nephew by giving him such a talking to&ndash;&ndash;she
could use language, the Hen could, when she
started in at it&ndash;&ndash;as would make him sorrier&rsquo;n
usual he&rsquo;d ever been born; and I guess, from
the looks of her, that was what at the first
jump she meant to do. But she was a quick-thinking
one, the Hen was, and she had a
way of getting more funny notions into that
good-looking head of hers than any other
woman that ever walked around on this earth
alive&ndash;&ndash;and so she give us all a real jolt by
playing out cards we wasn&rsquo;t expecting at all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Just as sudden as a wink, she sort of twitched
and twinkled&ndash;&ndash;same as she always did when
she was up to some new bit of deviltry&ndash;&ndash;and
when she set her stamps to going she talked
like as if she was real pleased. She didn&rsquo;t
look, though, as good-natured as she talked&ndash;&ndash;keeping
on being straightened up, and having
a kind of setness in her jaws and a snappiness
in them big black eyes of hers that
made everybody but Hart&rsquo;s nephew, who
was too drunk to know anything, dead sure
she still was mad all the way through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;ll lend &rsquo;em to you, and I guess he
will, why don&rsquo;t you get into Mr. Hill&rsquo;s
boots?&rdquo; she said to Hart&rsquo;s nephew. And
then she fetched up a nice sort of smile, and
said to him real friendly-sounding: &ldquo;I do
like stage-drivers, and that&rsquo;s a fact&ndash;&ndash;and
there&rsquo;s no telling how pleasant I&rsquo;ll make
things for you if you&rsquo;ll take the coach across
to Santa F&eacute; to-morrow over that Sunday-school
road! Will you do it?&rdquo; And then
the Hen give him one of them fetching looks
of hers, and asked him over: &ldquo;Will you do
it&ndash;&ndash;to oblige <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>Now that was more words at one time than
the Hen had dropped on Hart&rsquo;s nephew since
he struck the camp; and as the few he&rsquo;d ever
got from her mostly hadn&rsquo;t been nice ones,
and these sounding to him&ndash;&ndash;he being drunk&ndash;&ndash;like
as if they was real good-natured, he
was that pleased he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.
Of course he was dead set on the Hen, same
as everybody else was&ndash;&ndash;she truly was a
powerful fine woman&ndash;&ndash;and it just was funny
to see how he tried to steady himself on his
legs gentlemanly, and was all over fool smiles.</p>
<p>So he said back to the Hen&ndash;&ndash;speaking slow,
to keep his words from tumbling all over each
other&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d just drive that coach across to
Santa F&eacute; a-hooping if Hill&rsquo;d lend it to him;
and then he asked Hill if he might have it&ndash;&ndash;and
told him he could trust him to handle it
in good shape, because everybody knowed he
was a real daisy at driving mules.</p>
<p>For a fact, Hart&rsquo;s nephew did manage
well at mule-driving. It was one of the
blame few things that fool knowed how to
do. Denver Jones allowed it was because
he was related to &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;on the father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Just for this once, Mr. Hill,&rdquo; said the
Hen, speaking coaxy. And she got her head
round a little&ndash;&ndash;so Hart&rsquo;s nephew couldn&rsquo;t see
what she was doing&ndash;&ndash;and give Hill a wink
to come into the game.</p>
<p>Hill didn&rsquo;t know what in the world the
Hen was up to&ndash;&ndash;nobody ever did know what
that Hen was up to when once she got started&ndash;&ndash;but
he reckoned he could take it back in
the morning if he didn&rsquo;t think what she
wanted would answer, so in he come: telling
Hart&rsquo;s nephew he might have the coach to
do anything (Hill was a kind of a careless
talker) he damn pleased with; and saying he&rsquo;d
have it hitched up and ready down at the
deepo next morning, same as usual, so he
could start right off when the Denver train
come in.</p>
<p>When things was settled, all quick that
way, Hart&rsquo;s nephew took to squirming&ndash;&ndash;he
seeing, drunk as he was, he&rsquo;d bit off a blame
sight more&rsquo;n he cared to chew. But with the
Hen right after him&ndash;&ndash;and Hill and all the
rest of the boys backing her, they being sure
she&rsquo;d dandy cards up her sleeve for the queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
game she was playing&ndash;&ndash;he couldn&rsquo;t make
nothing by all his squirms. The boys got at
him and told him anybody could see he was
afraid; and the Hen got at him and told him
anybody could see he wasn&rsquo;t, and she said
she knew he was about the bravest man
alive; and Hill got at him and told him the
road had improved so, lately, the nearest to
road-agents you ever seen on it was burros
and cotton-tail rabbits; and all of &rsquo;em together
kept getting more drinks in him right
along. So the upshot of it was: first Hart&rsquo;s
nephew stopped his squirming; and then he
took to telling what a holy wonder he was at
mule-driving; and then he went to blowing
the biggest kind&ndash;&ndash;till he got so he couldn&rsquo;t
talk no longer&ndash;&ndash;about what he&rsquo;d do in the
shooting line if any road-agents come around
trying their monkey-shine hold-ups on <i>him</i>!
So it ended, good enough, by their getting
him fixed tight in his hole.</p>
<p>The boys kept things going with him pretty
late that night, and when he showed up in
the morning at the deepo&ndash;&ndash;a delegation seeing
to it he got there, and Hill having the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
coach all ready for him&ndash;&ndash;he still had on him
a fairly sizable jag. But he&rsquo;d sobered up
enough&ndash;&ndash;having slept quite a little, and
soaked his head at the railroad tank&ndash;&ndash;to
want to try all he knew how to spill himself
out of his job. It took all the Hen could do&ndash;&ndash;the
Hen had got up early and come down
to the deepo a-purpose to attend to him&ndash;&ndash;and
all the boys could do helping her, to get
him up on that coach-box and boosted off
out of town.</p>
<p>He was that nervous he was shaking all
over; and what made him nervouser was
having no passengers&ndash;&ndash;nobody for Santa F&eacute;
having come in on the Denver train. It was
just a caution to see his shooting outfit! The
box of the coach looked like it was a gun-shop&ndash;&ndash;being
piled up with two Winchesters
and a double-barrelled shot-gun (the shot-gun,
he said, was to cripple anybody he
didn&rsquo;t think it was needful to kill); and
beside that he had a machete some Mexican
lent him hooked on to his belt, and along
with it a brace of derringers and two forty-fives.
Hill was the only one who didn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
laugh fit to kill himself over that layout.
Hill said Hart&rsquo;s nephew done just right to
take along all the guns he could get a-hold
of; and Hill said he&rsquo;d attended to the proper
loading of every one of them weepons himself.</p>
<p>At last&ndash;&ndash;with all the boys laughing away
and firing fool talk at him, and the Hen
keeping him up to the collar by going on
about how brave he was&ndash;&ndash;he did manage to
whip up his mules and start off. Sick was
no name for him&ndash;&ndash;and he was so scared stiff
he looked like he was about ready to cry.
After he&rsquo;d got down the slope, and across the
bridge over the Rio Grande, and was walking
his mules on that first little stretch of sandy
road on the way to La Ca&ntilde;ada, we could see
him reaching down and fussing over his layout
of guns.</p>
<p>For a cold fact, there was a right smart
chance that Hart&rsquo;s nephew&ndash;&ndash;and &rsquo;specially
because his fool luck made most things come
to him contrary&ndash;&ndash;really might run himself
into a hold-up; and, if he did, it was like as
not his chips might get called in. For all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Hill&rsquo;s funny talk about meeting nothing
worse&rsquo;n burros and cotton-tail rabbits, that
road was a bad road&ndash;&ndash;and things was liable
to occur. Hill himself was taking his chances,
and he blame well knowed it, every day.
But it was the sense of the meeting that if a
hold-up of that coach attended by fatalities
was coming, it couldn&rsquo;t come at a better time
than when Hart&rsquo;s nephew was on the box&ndash;&ndash;the
feeling being general that Hart&rsquo;s nephew
was one that could be spared. I guess Bill
Hart felt just the same about it as the rest
of us&ndash;&ndash;leastways, he didn&rsquo;t strain himself
any trying to keep his nephew home.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Things went kind of nervous that day at
Palomitas. All the boys seemed to have a
feeling, somehow, there was going to be happenings;
and we all just sort of idled round
waiting for &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;taking more drinks &rsquo;n usual,
and in spite of the drinks getting every
minute lower and lower in our minds. Except
the day Hart&rsquo;s aunt spent with him,
and Santa F&eacute; Charley run the kindergarten,
I reckon it was the quietest day we ever went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
through&ndash;&ndash;at least till we got along to the
clean-up that turned Palomitas into what
some of us felt was a blame sight too much
of a Sunday-school town.</p>
<p>One reason why we all was so serious was because
the Sage-Brush Hen&ndash;&ndash;who started most
of what happened&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t show up as usual;
and all hands got a real jolt when some of
the boys went off to the Forest Queen to ask
about her, and old Tenderfoot Sal told &rsquo;em
she was laying down in her room and wasn&rsquo;t
feeling well. The Hen being always an out-and-out
hustler, and hard as an Indian pony,
her not being well shook us up bad. Everybody
was friends with her, same as she was
friends with everybody&ndash;&ndash;even when she got
into one of her tantrums, and took to jawing
you, you couldn&rsquo;t help liking her&ndash;&ndash;and knowing
she wasn&rsquo;t feeling like she ought to feel
put a big lot more of a damper on all hands.
So we just kept on taking drinks and getting
miserabler with &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;and feeling all the time
surer something was coming bouncing out at
us from round the corner, and wondering
what kind of a stir-up we was likely to have.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>It was along about four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon the cyclone struck us; and it was
such a small-sized one, when we did get it,
we didn&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or swear.
But the cyclone himself didn&rsquo;t think there
was anything small about him: being Hart&rsquo;s
nephew&ndash;&ndash;so scared to death all the few wits
he ever had was knocked clean out of him&ndash;&ndash;who
come into Palomitas, white as white-wash,
riding bareback one of the coach
mules.</p>
<p>He just sort of rolled off the mule, in front
of the Forest Queen, and went in to the bar
and got four drinks in him before he could
speak a word&ndash;&ndash;and then he said he&rsquo;d been
held up at the Barranca Grande by about
two hundred road-agents who&rsquo;d opened up
on him and killed all the mules except the
one he&rsquo;d got away on; and his getting away
at all, he said, was only because he&rsquo;d put up
such a fight he&rsquo;d scared &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;and after that
because they couldn&rsquo;t hit him when once he
was off, and had the mule going on a dead
run. Then he took two more drinks, and
told his story all over again; and as it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
about the same story both times&ndash;&ndash;and he so
scared, and by the time he told it over again
so set up with his drinks, it didn&rsquo;t seem
likely he&rsquo;d sense enough left to be lying&ndash;&ndash;the
boys allowed like enough it was true.</p>
<p>What he had to tell&ndash;&ndash;except he piled on
more road-agents than was needed&ndash;&ndash;was
about reasonable. He said he&rsquo;d done well
enough as far as Pojuaque&ndash;&ndash;where he&rsquo;d had
his dinner and changed mules, same as usual,
at old man Bouquet&rsquo;s. And after he&rsquo;d left
Pojuaque he&rsquo;d got along all right, he said,
except he had to go slow through the sandhills,
till he come to the Barranca Grande.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bad place, that barranca is. The
road goes sharp down into it, and then sharp
up out of it&ndash;&ndash;and both banks so steep you
want all the brakes you&rsquo;ve got to get to the
bottom of it, and more mules than you&rsquo;re
likely to have to get to the top on the other
side.</p>
<p>Well, Hart&rsquo;s nephew said he&rsquo;d just got the
coach down to the bottom of the barranca&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d
took the last of the slope at a run, he
said, and was licking away at his mules for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
all he was worth to start &rsquo;em up the far side&ndash;&ndash;when
the road-agents opened on him, being
hid in among the cedar-bushes, from the
top of the bank and from both sides of the
trail. You never seen such a blaze of shooting
in all your life, Hart&rsquo;s nephew said; and
he said before he&rsquo;d a chance to get a gun up
all his mules was hit but one. He said he
jumped quick from the box, taking both
Winchesters and the shot-gun with him,
and having his guns and the derringers in his
belt beside, and got behind the one mule that
hadn&rsquo;t been downed and opened up on the
bushes where the smoke was and let go as
hard as he knowed how. He said he must
a-killed more&rsquo;n twenty of &rsquo;em, he guessed,
judging by the yelling and groaning, and by
the way they slacked up on their fire. Their
slacking that way give him a chance, he said,
and he took it&ndash;&ndash;cutting the mule loose from
the harness with one hand, while he kept on
blazing away over her back with the other;
then letting &rsquo;em have it from both hands for
a minute, from what guns he had left that
wasn&rsquo;t empty, to sort of paralyze &rsquo;em; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
then getting quick on the mule&rsquo;s back and
starting her down the barranca on a dead
run.</p>
<p>He had balls buzzing all about him, he
said, till he got out of sight around a turn in
the barranca; and he said before he made
that turn he looked back once and saw a big
feller up on top of the bank letting off at
him as hard as he could go. Just to show
he still had fight in him, he said, he let off
back at him with his two derringers&ndash;&ndash;which
was all he had left to shoot with&ndash;&ndash;and he
was pretty sure, though of course it was only
luck did it with the mule bouncing him so,
the big feller went down. He was a tremendous
tall man, he said; and he guessed he was
a Greaser, seeing he had a big black beard
and was dressed in Greaser clothes.</p>
<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t mind owning up he was
scared bad while he was in it; but he said he
guessed anybody would a-been scared with
all them fellers shooting away at him&ndash;&ndash;and,
as he&rsquo;d made as good a fight of it as he
knowed how, he didn&rsquo;t think he was to be
blamed for ending by running from such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
crowd. He kept on down the barranca for
about two miles, he said, till he struck the
cross-trail to Tesuque; and he headed north
on that till he got to Pojuaque&ndash;&ndash;where he give
the mule a rest, she was blowed all to bits, the
mule was, he said; and he got some of old
man Bouquet&rsquo;s wine in him, feeling pretty
well blowed to bits himself; and then he come
along home.</p>
<p>Well, that seemed a straight enough
story. The only thing in it you really could
pick on&ndash;&ndash;except the number of road-agents,
he only having seen one, and the rest being
his scared guesswork&ndash;&ndash;was the mule not
being hit while he was doing all that firing
over the back of her. But all fights has
their queer chances in &rsquo;em; and that was a
chance that might a-happened, same as
others. Of course, the one big general thing
that didn&rsquo;t seem likely was that such a runt
as Hart&rsquo;s nephew should have stood up the
way he said he did to as much as one road-agent&ndash;&ndash;let
alone to the half-dozen or so that
like enough had got at him. But even a
thing like Hart&rsquo;s nephew sometimes will put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
up a fight when it&rsquo;s scared so bad it really
don&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n half know what it&rsquo;s doing&ndash;&ndash;and
the boys allowed he might have done his
fighting that way.</p>
<p>That the size of his scare had been big
enough to make him do a&rsquo;most anything
showed up from the way he kept on being
scared after it was all over&ndash;&ndash;he coming into
Palomitas looking like a wet white rag when,
by his own showing, he&rsquo;d been out of reach
of anybody&rsquo;s hurting him for four or five
hours anyway, and had had a chance to cool
off at Pojuaque while he was loading in old
man Bouquet&rsquo;s wine. And so, taking the
story by and large, the boys allowed that
likely most of it was true; and some of &rsquo;em
even went so far as to say maybe Hart&rsquo;s
nephew wasn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n half rotten, after all.</p>
<p>It was a good story to hear, anyway; and
everybody was sorry the Hen wasn&rsquo;t around
to hear it. But when some of the boys tried
to rout her out, Tenderfoot Sal stood &rsquo;em
off savage&ndash;&ndash;telling &rsquo;em to go about their
business, and the Hen&rsquo;s head was aching
bad. So the boys had to take it out in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
making Hart&rsquo;s nephew keep on telling all
he had to tell over and over; and he was glad
of the chance to, and did&ndash;&ndash;till he got so
many drinks in him he couldn&rsquo;t tell anything;
and then his uncle, with Shorty Smith helping,
took him off home.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Next morning, having pretty much slept
himself sober, Hart&rsquo;s nephew went cavorting
around Palomitas&ndash;&ndash;that little runt did&ndash;&ndash;like
he was about ten foot tall! He had the whole
thing over, in the course of the day, a dozen
times or more; and as he kept on telling
it&ndash;&ndash;now he was sober enough to add things
on&ndash;&ndash;it got to be about the biggest fight
with road-agents that ever was. The thing
that was biggest was the one man he allowed
he&rsquo;d really seen. Why, Goliath of Gath
wasn&rsquo;t in it with that fellow, according to
Hart&rsquo;s nephew! And he was that desperate
and dangerous to look at, he said, not many
men would a-had the nerve to try at him
with only a derringer&ndash;&ndash;and, what was more,
to bring him down. It was well along in the
afternoon before we got it for a fact that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Hart&rsquo;s nephew really had killed the Greaser.
The thing growed that way&ndash;&ndash;from his first
telling how he thought he&rsquo;d hit him&ndash;&ndash;until it
ended with the Greaser giving a yell like a
stuck pig; and then staggering and throwing
his arms up; and then rolling over and over
down the side of the barranca to the bottom
of it&ndash;&ndash;with his goose cooked all the way
through!</p>
<p>We was all down at the deepo waiting for
the Denver train to pull out, same as usual,
while Hart&rsquo;s nephew was doing his tallest
talking&ndash;&ndash;and while he was hard at it somebody
jumped up and sung out the Santa F&eacute;
coach was coming along on the other side
of the river from Santa Cruz. Well, that
was about the last thing anybody was expecting&ndash;&ndash;and
everybody hustled up off the
barrels and boxes where they was a-setting
and looked with all their eyes.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there the old coach was&ndash;&ndash;just
as it always was, about that time of
day&ndash;&ndash;coming along as natural as you please.
After a while, it keeping on getting nearer,
we could see it was old Hill himself up on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
box driving his mules in good shape; and
when he got along near the bridge we could
hear him swearing at &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;Hill did use
terrible bad language to them mules&ndash;&ndash;in
just his ordinary way. Then he rattled the
mules over the bridge and brought &rsquo;em a-clipping
up the slope this side of it; and then
in another minute he pulled right up at the
deepo platform where we all was. Hill was
laughing all over as he come up to us, and so
was a Mexican who was setting on the box
with him&ndash;&ndash;a nice tidy little chap, with a
powerful big black beard on him&ndash;&ndash;and Hill
sung out: &ldquo;Have you boys heard about the
hold-up?&rdquo; And then he and the little
Mexican got to laughing so it was a wonder
they didn&rsquo;t fall off.</p>
<p>Nobody was thinking nothing about Hart&rsquo;s
nephew&ndash;&ndash;till he let off a yell and sung out:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man held the coach up! Get a
bead on him with your guns!&rdquo; And he got
his own gun out&ndash;&ndash;and like enough would
a-done some fool thing with it if Santa F&eacute;
Charley, who was right by him, hadn&rsquo;t
smacked him and jerked it out of his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>Santa F&eacute; smacked so&rsquo;s to hurt him; and
he put his hand up to his face and said,
kind of whimpery: &ldquo;What are you hitting
me like that for, Charley? I ain&rsquo;t done nothing.
I tell you that man on the box with
Hill is the one I was held up by yesterday.
He&rsquo;s dangerous. If we don&rsquo;t get a-hold of
him quick he&rsquo;ll be doing something to us
with his gun!&rdquo; And Hart&rsquo;s nephew a&rsquo;most
broke out crying&ndash;&ndash;being all worked up, and
Santa F&eacute; having smacked him blame hard.</p>
<p>At that, Denver Jones cut in with: &ldquo;I
thought you said the one you was held up
by was more&rsquo;n fourteen foot high, and you
killed him? This man ain&rsquo;t big enough to
hold up a baby-carriage with you in it&ndash;&ndash;and
he&rsquo;s sure enough alive. What are you
giving us&ndash;&ndash;you blame fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no telling what kind of an answer
Denver would a-got from Hart&rsquo;s nephew&ndash;&ndash;for
he hadn&rsquo;t a chance to give him no answer
at all. Just then Hill did the talking, and
what Hill said was: &ldquo;Boys, he&rsquo;s dead right
about it. This here&rsquo;s the bad man that
held the coach up&ndash;&ndash;and as I was there, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
seen it done, and drove the coach on with
five mules to Santa F&eacute; afterwards, I guess I
know!&rdquo; And Hill, and the little Mexican
with him, just roared.</p>
<p>When Hill could talk for laughing, he went
on: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll own up right now, boys, I was
extry over-precautious when I fixed up with
empty shells that gun-shop Hart&rsquo;s nephew
took along on the coach when he started out
with it. For all the harm he done with them
guns, I might just as well a-left &rsquo;em loaded
the usual way. He was that scared when
this here gigantic ruffian stopped him&ndash;&ndash;I
just happened to be a-setting in among the
cedar-bushes at the time, smoking a seegar
and looking on sort of casual&ndash;&ndash;he couldn&rsquo;t
do nothing more&rsquo;n yell out he wasn&rsquo;t going
to shoot, and not to murder him; and then
down he jumped from the box&ndash;&ndash;me a-smoking
away looking at him, and this here ruffian
a-shooting his Winchester across the top
of the coach to where he said he thought he
seen a jack-rabbit&ndash;&ndash;and cut out the near
wheeler; and then he scrambled up anyhow
on that mule&rsquo;s back, and away he went down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
the barranca as hard as hell!&rdquo; (Hill oughtn&rsquo;t
to have said that word. But he was careless
in his talk, Hill was, and he did).</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Hart&rsquo;s nephew being scared that
way,&rdquo; Hill went on, a&rsquo;most choking, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
count one way or the other when you get
down to the facts. It was this here dangerous
devil that done that wicked deed, and he done
it all alone by his dangerous self. At the
risk of my life, gentlemen, I&rsquo;ve got a-hold of
him to bring him to justice, and here he is.
And I guess the sooner we yank him up to
the usual telegraph-pole, and so get shut of
him, the sooner it&rsquo;ll be safe for folks to travel
these roads. He&rsquo;s the most dangerous I
ever see,&rdquo; said Hill, and by that time Hill
was so near busted with his laughing he was
purple; &ldquo;and what makes him such a particular
holy terror is he goes disguised!&rdquo;
And then&ndash;&ndash;choking so he could hardly speak
plain&ndash;&ndash;Hill whipped round to the little Mexican
and says to him: &ldquo;Get your disguise
off of you, you murdersome critter! Get it
off, I say, and give these gentlemen a look
at the terrible wicked face of you&ndash;&ndash;before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
you and that telegraph-pole gets to being
friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the little Mexican switched his
big black beard off&ndash;&ndash;and right smack there
before us was the Sage-Brush Hen! You
never heard such a yell as the boys give in all
your born days!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And you never in all your born days saw
such goings on as there was that night at
the Forest Queen! Everybody in Palomitas
was right there. The other banks and bars
hadn&rsquo;t a soul left in &rsquo;em but the dealers and
the drink-slingers&ndash;&ndash;and they, not having
nothing to do at home, just shut up shop
and come along too. All the girls from all
the dance-halls showed up, the Hen being
real down popular with &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;which told well
for her&ndash;&ndash;and they wanting to see the fun.
Cherry happened to be down from his ranch
that night; and Becker got wind of what was
up and footed it across from Santa Cruz de
la Ca&ntilde;ada; and word was sent to the Elbogen
brothers&ndash;&ndash;they was real clever young fellows,
them two Germans&ndash;&ndash;and over they come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
a-kiting on their buck-board from San Juan.
I guess it was about the biggest jam the Forest
Queen ever had.</p>
<p>Hart&rsquo;s nephew was the only one around
the place who hung back a little, but he got
there all right&ndash;&ndash;being fished out of an empty
flour-barrel, where he&rsquo;d hid under the counter
in his uncle&rsquo;s store, and brought along by the
invitation committee sent to look for him all
dabbed over with flour.</p>
<p>Some thought the way they used Hart&rsquo;s
nephew that night was just a little mite too
hard lines&ndash;&ndash;he not being let to have as much
as a single drink in him, and so kept plumb
sober while the Hen give him his medicine;
but all hands allowed&ndash;&ndash;after his sassy talk to
her&ndash;&ndash;he didn&rsquo;t get no more&rsquo;n she&rsquo;d a right to
give. She just went at him like a blister, the
Hen did; and she blistered him worse because
she did it in her own funny way&ndash;&ndash;telling him
she did just dote on stage-drivers, and if he
really wanted to please her he&rsquo;d take Hill&rsquo;s
job regular; and leading the boys up to him
and introducing him, lady-like, as &ldquo;the hold-up
hero&rdquo;; and asking him to please to tell her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
all about that fourteen-foot road-agent he&rsquo;d
killed; and just rubbing the whole thing in on
him every way she knowed how. Before
the Hen got done with him he was about the
sickest man, Hart&rsquo;s nephew was, you ever
seen! But I guess it learned him quite a
little about how when he talked to ladies he&rsquo;d
better be polite.</p>
<p>Fun wasn&rsquo;t no name that night for that
Hen! She kept on wearing her Mexican
clothes, and she did look real down cute in
&rsquo;em; and she&rsquo;d got a God-forsaken old rusty
pepper-box six-shooter from somewheres,
and went flourishing it about saying it was
what she&rsquo;d held up the coach with; and in between
times, when she wasn&rsquo;t deviling Hart&rsquo;s
nephew, she&rsquo;d go round the room drawing
beads on the boys with her pepper-box, and
making out she was dangerous by putting
her big black beard on, and standing up in
attitudes so the boys might see, she said,
how road-agenty she looked and bad and
bold! Why, the Hen did act so comical
that night all hands pretty near died with
their laugh!</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>SANTA F&Eacute; CHARLEY&rsquo;S KINDERGARTEN</h3>
</div>
<p>When Bill Hart, who was a
good fellow and kept the principal
store in Palomitas, got
word his aunt in Vermont was
coming out to pay him a visit&ndash;&ndash;it
being too late to stop her, and he knowing
he&rsquo;d have to worry the thing through
somehow till he could start her back East
again&ndash;&ndash;he was the worst broke-up man you
ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! Joe,&rdquo; Hart said, when he
was telling Cherry about it, &ldquo;Palomitas ain&rsquo;t
no sort of a town to bring aunts to&ndash;&ndash;and it&rsquo;s
about the last town I know of where Aunt
Maria&rsquo;ll fit in! She&rsquo;s the old-fashioned kind,
right up to the limit, Aunt Maria is. Sewing-societies
and Sunday-schools is the hands she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
holds flushes in; and she has the preacher
once a week to supper; and when it comes
to kindergartens&ndash;&ndash;Hart was so worked up
he talked careless&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s simply hell! What&rsquo;s
a woman like that going to do, I want to
know, in a place like this&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s mainly
made up of saloons and dance-halls and faro-banks,
and everybody mostly drunk, and
shooting-scrapes going on all the time? It
just makes me sick to think about it.&rdquo; And
Hart groaned.</p>
<p>Cherry swore for a while, sort of friendly
and sociable&ndash;&ndash;he was a sympathetic man,
Cherry was, and always did what he could
to help&ndash;&ndash;and as Hart was too far gone to
swear for himself, in a way that amounted
to anything, hearing what Cherry had to
say seemed to do him good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stop her, if there was any stop to
her,&rdquo; he went on, in a minute or two, speaking
hopeless and miserable; &ldquo;but there ain&rsquo;t.
She says she&rsquo;s starting the day after she
writes&ndash;&ndash;having a chance to come sudden with
friends&ndash;&ndash;and that means she&rsquo;s most here
now. And there&rsquo;s no heading her off&ndash;&ndash;because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
she says the friends she&rsquo;s hooked fast
to may be coming to Pueblo and may be
coming to Santa F&eacute;. But it don&rsquo;t make any
difference, she says, as she&rsquo;s told she can get
down easy by the railroad from Pueblo, or
she can slide across to Palomitas by &rsquo;a short
and pleasant coach-ride&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s what she
calls it&ndash;&ndash;from Santa F&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all she tells about her coming.
The rest of what&rsquo;s in her letter is about how
glad she&rsquo;ll be to see me, and about how glad
she knows I&rsquo;ll be to see her&ndash;&ndash;being lonely so
far from my folks, and likely needing my
clothes mended, and pleased to be eating
some of her home-made pies. It&rsquo;s just like
Aunt Maria to put in things like that. You
see, she brought me up&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;s never got
out of her head I&rsquo;m more&rsquo;n about nine years
old. What I feel like doing is going out in
the sage-brush and blowing the top of my
fool head off, and letting the coyotes eat
what&rsquo;s left of me and get me out of the
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart really did look as if he meant it,
Cherry said afterwards. He was the miserablest-looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
man, he said, he&rsquo;d ever seen
alive.</p>
<p>Cherry said he begun to have a notion,
though, while Hart was talking, how the
thing might be worked so there wouldn&rsquo;t be
no real trouble if it could be fixed so Hart&rsquo;s
aunt wouldn&rsquo;t stay in Palomitas more&rsquo;n
about a day; and he come right on down to
the Forest Queen to see if he could get the
boys to help him put it through. He left
Hart clearing out the room he kept flour and
meal in&ndash;&ndash;being the cleanest&ndash;&ndash;trying to rig
up for his aunt some sort of a bunking-place.
He was going to give her his own cot and
mattress, he said; and he could fit her out
with a looking-glass and a basin and pitcher
all right because he kept them sort of things
to sell; and he said he&rsquo;d make the place
extra tidy by putting a new horse-blanket on
the floor. Seeing his way to getting a grip
on that much of the contract, Cherry said,
seemed to make him feel a little less bad.</p>
<p>Cherry waited till the deal was over, when
he got to the Forest Queen; and then he
asked Santa F&eacute; Charley if he&rsquo;d let him speak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to the boys for a minute before the game
went on. He was always polite and obliging,
Santa F&eacute; was, and he said of course he might;
and he rapped on the table with his derringer
for order, and said Mr. Cherry had the
floor. Charley was old-fashioned in his ways
of fighting. He always had a six-shooter in
his belt, same as other folks; but he said he
kept it mainly for show. Derringers, he said,
was better and surer&ndash;&ndash;because you could
work &rsquo;em around in your pocket while the
other fellow was getting his gun out, and
before he was ready for business you could
shoot him right through your pants. Later
on, it was that very way Santa F&eacute; shot Hart.
But he always was friendly with Hart till
he did shoot him; and it was more his backing
than anything else&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;specially when it
come to the kindergarten&ndash;&ndash;that made Cherry&rsquo;s
plan for helping Hart out go through.</p>
<p>When the game was stopped, and the boys
was all listening, Cherry told about the hole
Hart was in and allowed it was a deep one;
and he said it was only fair&ndash;&ndash;Hart having
done good turns for most everybody, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
time and another&ndash;&ndash;his friends should be
willing to take some trouble to get him out
of it. Hart&rsquo;s aunt, he said, come from a
quiet part of Vermont, and likely would be
jolted bad when she struck Palomitas if
things was going the ordinary way&ndash;&ndash;she being
elderly, and like enough a little set in her
ways, and not used much to crazy drunks,
and shooting-matches, and such kinds of
lively carryings-on. But she&rsquo;d only stay one
day, or at most a day and a half&ndash;&ndash;Hart having
agreed to take her right back East himself,
if she couldn&rsquo;t be got rid of no other
way&ndash;&ndash;and that gave &rsquo;em a chance to fix
things so her feelings wouldn&rsquo;t be hurt,
though doing it was going to be hard on all
hands. And then, having got the boys
worked up wondering what he was driving
at, Cherry went ahead and said he wanted
&rsquo;em to agree&ndash;&ndash;just for the little while Hart&rsquo;s
aunt was going to stay there&ndash;&ndash;to run Palomitas
like it was a regular back-East Sunday-school
town. He knew he was asking a good
deal, he said, but he did ask it&ndash;&ndash;and he appealed
to the better feelings of the gentlemen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
assembled around that faro-table to do that
much to get Bill Hart out of his hole. Then
Cherry said he wasn&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s orator, but
he guessed he&rsquo;d made clear what he wanted
to lay before the meeting; and he said he was
much obliged, and had pleasure in setting up
drinks for the crowd.</p>
<p>As was to be expected of &rsquo;em, all the boys&ndash;&ndash;knowing
Hart for a square-acting man,
and liking him&ndash;&ndash;tumbled right off to Cherry&rsquo;s
plan. Santa F&eacute; said&ndash;&ndash;this was after they&rsquo;d
had their drinks&ndash;&ndash;he s&rsquo;posed he was chairman
of the meeting, and he guessed he spoke
the sense of the meeting when he allowed
Mr. Cherry&rsquo;s scheme was about the only way
out for their esteemed fellow-citizen, Mr.
Hart, and it ought to go through. But as
it was a matter that seriously affected the
comfort and convenience of everybody in
Palomitas, he said, it was only square to
take a vote on it&ndash;&ndash;and so he&rsquo;d ask all in
favor of Mr. Cherry&rsquo;s motion to say &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
And everybody in the room&ndash;&ndash;except the few
that was asleep, or too drunk to say anything&ndash;&ndash;said
&ldquo;Ay&rdquo; as loud as they knowed how.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cherry&rsquo;s motion is carried, gentlemen,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; said; &ldquo;and I will now appoint
a committee to draught a notice to be
posted at the deepo, and to call around at
the other banks and saloons in the town and
notify verbally our fellow-citizens of the
action we have taken&ndash;&ndash;and I will ask the
Hen here kindly to inform the other ladies
of Palomitas of our intentions, and to request
their assistance in realizing them. She had
better tell them, I reckon, that the way they
can come to the front most effectively in
this crisis is by keeping entirely out of sight
in the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sage-Brush Hen, along with some of
the other girls, had come in from the back
room&ndash;&ndash;where the dancing was&ndash;&ndash;to find out
what the circus was about; and when they
caught on to what Palomitas was going to
be like when Hart&rsquo;s aunt struck it they all
just yelled.</p>

&ldquo;WROTE OUT A NOTICE THAT WAS TACKED UP ON THE DEEPO DOOR&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come out well once as the Baptist
minister, Charley,&rdquo; the Hen said, shaking all
over; &ldquo;and I reckon you can do it again&ndash;&ndash;only
it won&rsquo;t be so easy showing off the new
church and the parsonage by daylight as it
was in the dark. About us girls laying low,
maybe you&rsquo;re right and maybe you&rsquo;re not
right. Anyway, don&rsquo;t you worry about us.
All I&rsquo;ll say is, it won&rsquo;t be the ladies in this
combine that&rsquo;ll give anything away!&rdquo; And
she and the other girls got so to laughing over
it they all of &rsquo;em had to set down.</p>
<p>Cherry was more pleased than a little the
way things had gone&ndash;&ndash;and he said so to the
boys, and set up drinks all round again.
Then he and Abe Simons&ndash;&ndash;they was the committee
to do it&ndash;&ndash;wrote out a notice that was
tacked up on the deepo door and read this
way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='center'>TO THE CITIZENS OF PALOMITAS</p>
<p>Mr. William Hart&rsquo;s aunt is coming to
pay him a visit, and will strike this town
either by the Denver train to-morrow
morning or the Santa F&eacute; coach to-morrow
afternoon.</p>
<p>She is a perfect lady, and it is ordered
that during her stay in Palomitas this
town has got to behave itself so her feelings
won&rsquo;t be hurt. She is to be took
care of and given a pleasant impression.
All fights and drunks must be put off till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
she&rsquo;s gone. Persons neglecting to do so
will be taken out into the sage-brush by
members of the committee, and are likely
to get hurt.</p>
<p>Mr. Hart regrets this occurrence as
much as anybody, and agrees his aunt&rsquo;s
visit sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t last beyond a day and a half
if she comes down from Denver, and only
one day if she comes in from Santa F&eacute;.</p>
<p class='ralign'>(<i>Signed</i>) THE COMMITTEE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Cherry got a-hold of Hart and told
him what the town had agreed to do for him
he was that grateful&ndash;&ndash;being all worked up,
anyway&ndash;&ndash;he pretty near cried.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Hart&rsquo;s aunt come in on
Hill&rsquo;s coach from Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;her friends having
gone down that way by the Atchison&ndash;&ndash;and
as Hill had been at the meeting at the
Forest Queen he was able to give things a
good start. Hill always was a friendly sort
of a fellow, and&ndash;&ndash;except he used terrible bad
language, which he said come of his having
to drive mules&ndash;&ndash;he was a real first-class
ladies&rsquo; man.</p>
<p>Hill said he spotted Hart&rsquo;s aunt the minute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
he set his eyes on her waiting for the coach
at the Fonda, there not being likely to be
more&rsquo;n one in the Territory of that kind.
She was a trig little old lady, dressed up in
black clothes as neat as wax, he said, with a
little black bonnet setting close to her head;
and she wore gold specs and had a longish
nose. But she&rsquo;d a real friendly look about
her, he said; and while she spoke a little
precise and particular she wasn&rsquo;t a bit stuck-up,
and seemed to be taking things about as
they happened to come along. When he
asked her if she wouldn&rsquo;t set up on the box
with him, so she could see the country, she
said that was just what would suit her; and
up she come, he said, as spry as a queer little
bird. Then he whipped up his mules&ndash;&ndash;being
careful not to use any language&ndash;&ndash;and got the
coach started, and begun right off to be
agreeable by telling her he guessed he had
the pleasure of knowing her nephew, and
asking her if she wasn&rsquo;t the aunt of Mr.
William Hart.</p>
<p>Well, of course that set things to going
pleasant between &rsquo;em; and when she&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
allowed she was Hart&rsquo;s aunt, and said she
was glad to meet a friend of his, she started
in asking all the questions about Bill and
about Palomitas she knowed how to ask.</p>
<p>Hill said he guessed that day they had to
lay off the regular recording angel and put
a hired first-class stenographer on his job&ndash;&ndash;seeing
how no plain angel, not writing shorthand,
could a-kept up with all the lies he
felt it his duty to tell if he was going to
bring Bill through in good shape and keep
up the reputation of the town. It wasn&rsquo;t
square to charge them lies up to him, anyway,
Hill said, seeing he only was playing
Cherry&rsquo;s hand for him; and he said he hoped
they was put in Cherry&rsquo;s bill. By the time
he&rsquo;d got through with his fairy tales, he said,
he&rsquo;d give Hart such a character he didn&rsquo;t
know him himself; and he&rsquo;d touched up
Palomitas till he&rsquo;d got it so it might a-been
a town just outside Boston&ndash;&ndash;only he allowed
they was sometimes troubled with hard cases
passing through; and he told her of course
she&rsquo;d find things kind of half-baked and noisy
out there on the frontier. And she must remember,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
he told her, that all the folks in the
town was young&ndash;&ndash;young men who&rsquo;d brought
their young wives with &rsquo;em, come to hustle
in a new country&ndash;&ndash;and she mustn&rsquo;t mind if
things went livelier&rsquo;n the way she was used
to back East.</p>
<p>Hill said she said she wasn&rsquo;t expecting to
find things like they was at home, and she
guessed she&rsquo;d manage all right&ndash;&ndash;seeing she
always got on well with young people, and
wasn&rsquo;t a bit set in her own ways. And she
said she was as pleased as she was surprised
to find out the kind of a town Palomitas was&ndash;&ndash;because
her nephew William&rsquo;s letters had
led her to think it had a good many bad
characters in it; and he&rsquo;d not mentioned
any church but the Catholic one where the
natives went; and as to the Bible Class and the
Friendly Aid Society, he&rsquo;d never said a word
about &rsquo;em at all. She went on talking so
cheerful and pleasant, Hill said, it give him
creeps in his back; and he got so rattled the
last half of the run&ndash;&ndash;coming on from Pojuaque,
where they&rsquo;d had dinner at old man
Bouquet&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;he hardly knowed what he&rsquo;d told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
and what he hadn&rsquo;t, and whether he was
standing on his head or his heels.</p>
<p>Being that way, he made the only break
that gave trouble afterwards. She asked
him if there was a school in Palomitas, and
he told her there wasn&rsquo;t, because all the folks
in town was so young&ndash;&ndash;except the natives,
who hadn&rsquo;t no use for schools&ndash;&ndash;they hadn&rsquo;t
any children big enough to go to one. And
then she said sudden, and as it seemed to
him changing the subject: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a
kindergarten?&rdquo; Hill said he&rsquo;d never heard
tell of such a concern; but he sized it up to
be some sort of a fancy German garden&ndash;&ndash;like
the one Becker&rsquo;d fixed up for himself over
to Santa Cruz&ndash;&ndash;and he said he allowed, from
the way she asked about it, it was what
Palomitas ought to have. So he told her
there was, and it was the best one in the
Territory&ndash;&ndash;and let it go at that. He said
she said she was glad to hear it, as she took
a special interest in kindergartens, and she&rsquo;d
go and see it the first thing.</p>
<p>Hill said he knowed he&rsquo;d put his foot in it
somehow; but as he didn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
put his foot in it, he just switched her off by
telling her about the Dorcas Society. He
had the cards for that, he said, because his
mother&rsquo;d helped run a Dorcas Society back
East and he knowed what he was talking
about. The Palomitas one met Thursdays,
he told her, at the Forest Queen. That was
the principal hotel, he told her, and was kept
by Mrs. Major Rogers, who was an officer&rsquo;s
widow and had started the society to make
clothes for some of the Mexican poor folks&ndash;&ndash;and
he said it was a first-rate charity and
worked well. It tickled him so, he said,
thinking of any such doings at the Forest
Queen&ndash;&ndash;with old Tenderfoot Sal, of all people,
bossing the job!&ndash;&ndash;he had to work off the
laugh he had inside of him by taking to licking
his mules.</p>
<p>But it went all right with the little old
lady; and she was that interested he had
to strain himself, he said, making up more
stories about it&ndash;&ndash;till by good luck she took
to telling him about the Dorcas Society she
belonged to herself, back home in Vermont;
and was so full of it she kept things going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
easy for him till they&rsquo;d crossed the bridge
over the Rio Grande and was coming up the
slope into the town at a walk.</p>
<p>Up at the top of the slope Santa F&eacute; Charley
stood a-waiting for &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;looking, of course,
in them black clothes and a white tie on, like
he was a sure-enough preacher&ndash;&ndash;and as the
coach come along he sung out, pleasant and
friendly: &ldquo;Good-afternoon, Brother Hill. I
missed you at the Bible Class last evening.
No doubt you were detained unavoidably,
and it&rsquo;s all right. But be sure to come next
Friday. We don&rsquo;t get along well without
you, Brother Hill.&rdquo; And Santa F&eacute; took his
hat off stylish and made the old lady the
best sort of a bow.</p>
<p>Hill caught on quick and played right up
to Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s lead. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our minister,
Mr. Charles, ma&rsquo;am. The one I&rsquo;ve been
telling you about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just
friendly and sociable like that all the time.
He looks after the folks in this town closer&rsquo;n
any preacher I ever knowed.&rdquo; A part of
that, Hill said, was dead certain truth&ndash;&ndash;seeing
as Santa F&eacute; had his eyes out straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
along for everybody about the place who&rsquo;d
a dollar in his pocket, and wasn&rsquo;t satisfied
till he&rsquo;d scooped in that dollar over his table
at the Forest Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the new church we&rsquo;re building,&rdquo;
Hill went on, as they got to the top of the
slope and headed for the deepo. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
much to look at yet, the spire not being put
on; and it won&rsquo;t show up well, even when it
gets its spire on it, with churches East. But
we&rsquo;re going to be satisfied with it, seeing it&rsquo;s
the best we can do. You&rsquo;ll be interested to
know, ma&rsquo;am, your nephew give the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William hasn&rsquo;t let on anything about it,&rdquo;
Hart&rsquo;s aunt said, looking pleased all over.
&ldquo;But what in the world is a church doing
with a railroad track running into it, Mr.
Hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill said he&rsquo;d forgot about the track when
he settled to use the new freight-house for
church purposes; but he said he pulled himself
together quick and told her the track
was temp&rsquo;ry&ndash;&ndash;put in so building material
could unload right on the ground. And then
he took to talking about how obliging the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
railroad folks had been helping &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;and
kept a-talking that way till he got the coach
to the deepo, and didn&rsquo;t need to hustle making
things up any more. He said he never
was so thankful in his life as he was when his
stunt was done. He was just tired out, he
said, lying straight ahead all day over thirty
miles of bad road and not being able once to
speak natural to his mules.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Hart was waiting at the deepo, on the
chance his aunt would come in on the coach;
and when she saw him she give a little squeal,
she was so pleased, and hopped down in no
time off the box&ndash;&ndash;she was as brisk as a bee
in her doings&ndash;&ndash;and took to hugging him and
half crying over him just like he was a little
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, William,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am <i>so</i> happy
getting to you! And I&rsquo;m happier&rsquo;n I expected
to be, finding out how quiet and
respectable Palomitas is&ndash;&ndash;not a bit what
your letters made me think it was&ndash;&ndash;and such
real good people living in it, and everything
but the queer country and the queer mud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
houses just like it is at home. Mr. Hill has
been telling me all about it, coming over,
and about this new church you&rsquo;re building
that you gave the lot for. To think you&rsquo;ve
never told me! Oh, William, I am so glad
and so thankful that out here in this wild
region you&rsquo;ve kept serious-minded and are
turning out such a good man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart looked so mixed up over the way his
aunt was talking, and so sort of hopeless,
that Hill cut in quick and give him a lift.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not much at blowing about himself,
your nephew ain&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Hill said. &ldquo;Why,
he not only give the land for the church over
there&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and Hill pointed at the freight-house,
so Hart could ketch on&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but it was
him got the Company to lay them temp&rsquo;ry
tracks, so the building stuff could be took
right in. He&rsquo;s going to give a melodeon,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear William!&rdquo; Hart&rsquo;s aunt said. &ldquo;It
rejoices my heart you&rsquo;re doing all these
good deeds&ndash;&ndash;and all the others Mr. Hill&rsquo;s
been telling me about. I must kiss you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what I&rsquo;ve done ain&rsquo;t nothing,&rdquo;
Hart said, pulling himself together while she
was kissing him. &ldquo;Land&rsquo;s cheap, cheap as
it can be, out here; and I give the Company
such a lot of freight they&rsquo;re more&rsquo;n willing to
oblige me; and as to the melodeon&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart sort of gagged when he got to the
melodeon, and Santa F&eacute; Charley&ndash;&ndash;who&rsquo;d
come up while they all was talking away together&ndash;&ndash;reached
across the table and played
his hand. &ldquo;As to the melodeon, Mr. Hart,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; put in, &ldquo;you said that being in
business you could get it at a discount off.
But that does not appreciably lessen your
generosity, Mr. Hart; and your aunt&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Santa
F&eacute; took off his hat and bowed handsome&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is
justified in taking pride in your
good deeds. I am glad to tell her that in her
nephew our struggling church has its stanchest
pillar and its strongest stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the way it is about the
melodeon, Aunt Maria,&rdquo; Hart said, kind of
weak and mournful. &ldquo;Being in business,
I get melodeons at such a discount off that
giving &rsquo;em away ain&rsquo;t nothing to me at all.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
And now I guess we&rsquo;d better be getting along
home. It&rsquo;s a mighty mean home to take
you to, Aunt Maria; but there&rsquo;s one comfort&ndash;&ndash;as
you&rsquo;ll find out when I get the chance to
talk to you&ndash;&ndash;you won&rsquo;t have to stay in it
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a lot of the boys standing round
on the deepo platform watching the show,
and they all took their hats off respectful&ndash;&ndash;following
the lead Santa F&eacute; give &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;as
Hart started away up the track, to where his
store was, with his aunt on his arm. The
town looked like some place East keeping
Sunday: the Committee having talked strong
as to what they&rsquo;d do if things wasn&rsquo;t quiet,
and having rounded up&ndash;&ndash;and coralled in a
back room Denver Jones lent the use of&ndash;&ndash;the
few who&rsquo;d got drunk as usual because they
had to, and so had to be took care of that
way. It was a June evening, and the sun
about setting; and somehow it all was so
sort of peaceful and uncommon&ndash;&ndash;with everybody
in sight sober, and no fighting anywhere,
and that little old lady going along, believing
Palomitas was like that always, instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the hell on earth it was&ndash;&ndash;some of us more&rsquo;n
half believed we&rsquo;d gone to sleep and got
stuck in a dream.</p>
<p>Things was made dreamier by the looks
and doings of the Sage-Brush Hen. She was
the only lady of the town, the Hen was, who
took part in the ceremonies&ndash;&ndash;and likely it
was just about as well, for the sake of keeping
clear of surprises, the rest of &rsquo;em laid low.
As Hart and his aunt went off together up
the track, the Hen showed up coming along
down it; and she was dressed that pretty
and quiet&ndash;&ndash;in the plainest sort of a white
frock, and wearing a white sun-bonnet&ndash;&ndash;and
was looking so demure, like she could
when she&rsquo;d a mind to, nobody knowed at
first who she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being the minister&rsquo;s wife, I&rsquo;ve been taking
the liberty, Mr. Hart,&rdquo; she said, smiling
pleasant, when the three of &rsquo;em come together
on the track, &ldquo;of looking around a
little up at your place to see that everything
has been fixed for your company the way it
should be.&rdquo; (She hadn&rsquo;t been nowheres near
Hart&rsquo;s place, it turned out&ndash;&ndash;but Gospel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
truth wasn&rsquo;t just what there was most of that
day in Palomitas.) She went right on down
the track without stopping, passing on Hart&rsquo;s
side, and saying to him: &ldquo;My husband expects
you as usual at the Friendly Aid meeting
to-morrow evening, Mr. Hart. We never
seem half to get along, you know, when
you&rsquo;re not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart&rsquo;s aunt give a little jump, and said:
&ldquo;Why, William, that must be Mrs. Charles,
the minister&rsquo;s wife. What a pleasant-spoken
lady she is! We met her husband just as we
were driving into town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart said he come pretty near saying
back to her, &ldquo;The hell you did!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Hart
talked that careless way, sometimes&ndash;&ndash;but he
said he pulled up before it got out, and all
he did say was, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be at the head of the Dorcas
Society that Mr. Hill was telling me about,&rdquo;
Hart&rsquo;s aunt went on; &ldquo;and like enough she
manages the kindergarten, too. I suppose,
William, it&rsquo;s not surprising you haven&rsquo;t said
anything in your letters about the Dorcas
Society&ndash;&ndash;for all you were so liberal in helping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
it&ndash;&ndash;but I do think you might have told me
about the kindergarten, knowing what a
hobby of mine kindergartens are. I want to
go and see it to-morrow morning, the first
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s not in running order just now,&rdquo;
Hart said. &ldquo;Most of the children was took
sick with the influenza last week, and there&rsquo;s
whooping-cough and measles about, and so
the school committee closed it down. And
they had to stop, anyway, because they&rsquo;re
going to put a new roof on. I guess it won&rsquo;t
blow in again for about a month&ndash;&ndash;or maybe
more. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;you see, it
wasn&rsquo;t managed well, and got real down unpopular&ndash;&ndash;if
it&rsquo;ll blow in again at all. I&rsquo;m
sorry you won&rsquo;t be able to get to it, Aunt
Maria. Maybe it&rsquo;ll be running if you happen
to come out again next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how queer that is, William!&rdquo; Hart&rsquo;s
aunt said. &ldquo;Mr. Hill told me it was the best
kindergarten in New Mexico. But of course
you know. Anyhow, I can see the schoolroom
and the school fixtures, and Mrs.
Charles can tell me about it when I go to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Dorcas Society&ndash;&ndash;and that&rsquo;ll do most as well.
Of course I must get to the Dorcas Society.
Mrs. Charles will take me, I&rsquo;m sure. It meets,
Mr. Hill says, every Thursday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say where it was meeting now?&rdquo;
Hart asked. He was getting about desperate,
he told Cherry afterwards; and what he wanted
most was a chance to mash Hill&rsquo;s fool head
for putting him in such a lot of holes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did, William,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s
aunt; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m surprised you have to ask&ndash;&ndash;seeing
what an interest you take in the
Society, and how you&rsquo;ve helped it along. It
was just lovely of you to give them all those
goods out of your store to make up into
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&ndash;&ndash;that wasn&rsquo;t anything to do,&rdquo;
Hart said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the store comes with
a big discount&ndash;&ndash;same as melodeons. Sometimes
I feel as if I was saving money giving
things away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can talk about your generosity just
as you please, William,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
think it&rsquo;s noble of you. And Mr. Hill said
that Mrs. Major Rogers&ndash;&ndash;who keeps the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Forest Queen Hotel, he said, and lets the
Society have a room to meet in for nothing&ndash;&ndash;said
it was noble of you, too. I want to get
to know Mrs. Major Rogers right off. She
must be a very fine woman. She&rsquo;s an officer&rsquo;s
widow, Mr. Hill says, and a real lady, for all
she makes her living keeping a hotel out
here on the frontier. If she&rsquo;s a bit like that
sweet-looking Mrs. Charles I know we&rsquo;ll
get along. I&rsquo;m surprised, William, you&rsquo;ve
never told me what pleasant ladies live here.
It must make all the difference in the world.
Don&rsquo;t you think it would do for me not to be
formal, but just to go to Mrs. Major Rogers&rsquo;
hotel to-morrow and call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess&ndash;&ndash;well, I guess you hadn&rsquo;t better
go right off the first thing in the morning,
Aunt Maria,&rdquo; Hart said. Thinking of his
aunt going calling at the Forest Queen and
running up against Tenderfoot Sal, he said,
gave him the regular cold shakes. &ldquo;And
come to think of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use
your going to-morrow at all. Mrs.&ndash;&ndash;Mrs.
Major Rogers, as I happen to know, went up
to Denver yesterday; and she won&rsquo;t be back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
she told me, before some time on in the end
of next week&ndash;&ndash;likely as not, she said, she
wouldn&rsquo;t come then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By that time they&rsquo;d got along to Hart&rsquo;s
store, and Hart said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I
live, Aunt Maria. You see what sort of a
place it is. But I&rsquo;ve done my best to fix
things for you as well as I know how. Come
right along in&ndash;&ndash;and when we&rsquo;ve had supper
we&rsquo;ve got to have a talk.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Along about ten o&rsquo;clock that night Hart
come down to the Forest Queen looking pale
and haggard, and he was that broke up he
had to get three drinks in him before he
could say a word. Everybody was so interested,
wanting to hear what he had to tell
&rsquo;em, he didn&rsquo;t need to ask to have the game
stopped&ndash;&ndash;it just stopped of its own accord.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;d had his third drink, and was
beginning to feel better, he said he couldn&rsquo;t
thank everybody enough for the way they&rsquo;d
behaved; and that his aunt had gone to bed
tired out; and he&rsquo;d been talking with her
steady for two hours getting things settled;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
and she&rsquo;d ended by agreeing she&rsquo;d start back
East with him the next night&ndash;&ndash;he having
made out he&rsquo;d smash in his business if he
waited a minute longer&ndash;&ndash;and they was going
by the Denver train. And he&rsquo;d got her fixed
he said, so she&rsquo;d keep quiet through the
morning&ndash;&ndash;as she was going right at mending
his stockings and things the first thing when
she got up; and after that she was full of
getting to work with canned peaches and
making him a pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s going to happen in the afternoon,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the Lord only knows! That
blasted fool of a Ben Hill&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Hart spoke just
that bitter way about it&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t had no
more sense &rsquo;n to go and tell her this town&rsquo;s
full of kindergartens, and she&rsquo;s so worked up
there&rsquo;s no holding her, as kindergartens happens
to be the fullest hand she holds. I&rsquo;ve
allowed we have one&ndash;&ndash;things being as they
was, I had to&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;ve told her it&rsquo;s out of
order, and the children laid up with whooping-cough,
and the teacher sick a-bed, and
the outfit damaged by a fire we had, and&ndash;&ndash;and
the Lord knows what I haven&rsquo;t told her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
about the damn thing.&rdquo; (Hart was that
nervous he couldn&rsquo;t help speaking that way.)
&ldquo;But all I&rsquo;ve said hasn&rsquo;t made no difference.
She&rsquo;s just dead set on getting to what&rsquo;s left
of that kindergarten, and I can&rsquo;t budge her.
See it she will, she says; and I guess the upshot
of Hill&rsquo;s chuckle-headed talk&rsquo;ll be to
waste all the trouble we&rsquo;ve took by landing
us in the biggest give-away that ever was!&rdquo;
And Hart called for another drink, and had
to set down to take it&ndash;&ndash;looking pale.</p>
<p>All the boys felt terrible bad about the
hole Hart was in; and they felt worse because
none of &rsquo;em hadn&rsquo;t no notion what
a kindergarten did&ndash;&ndash;when it did anything&ndash;&ndash;and
that made &rsquo;em more ashamed Palomitas
hadn&rsquo;t one to show. Only Becker&ndash;&ndash;Becker&rsquo;d
happened to come over from Santa Cruz that
night&ndash;&ndash;sized it up right; and Becker shook
his head sort of dismal and said there wasn&rsquo;t
no use even thinking about it&ndash;&ndash;and that
looked like a settler, because Becker seemed
to know. Nobody didn&rsquo;t say nothing for a
minute or two; and then Ike Williams spoke
up&ndash;&ndash;he was the boss carpenter on the freight-house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
job, Ike was&ndash;&ndash;and said if what was
wanted could be made out of boards, and
made in a hurry, he&rsquo;d lay off the freight-house
gang the next morning and engage to have
one ready by noon.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; Charley&rsquo;d been sitting still thinking,
not saying a word. He let out a big
cuss&ndash;&ndash;and Charley wasn&rsquo;t given to cussing&ndash;&ndash;when
Ike made his offer; and then he banged
his hand down on the table so hard he set
the chips to flying, and he said: &ldquo;Mr. Hart,
don&rsquo;t you worry&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;re going to put this job
through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody jumped up at that&ndash;&ndash;some of &rsquo;em
scrambling for the dropped chips&ndash;&ndash;asking
Santa F&eacute; what he meant to do. But
Charley wouldn&rsquo;t answer &rsquo;em. &ldquo;Just you
trust to Ike and me, Bill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
fix your kindergarten all right&ndash;&ndash;only you
keep on telling your aunt it ain&rsquo;t a good one,
and how most of it got burned up in the fire.
It&rsquo;s luck you let on to her there&rsquo;d been a
fire&ndash;&ndash;that makes it as easy as rolling off a
log. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to bring her
down here at four o&rsquo;clock to-morrow afternoon&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
better till then keep her in the
house, mending you up and making you all
the pies she has a mind to&ndash;&ndash;and when she
gets here the kindergarten&rsquo;ll be here, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her here&ndash;&ndash;to the Forest Queen?&rdquo;
Hart said, speaking doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her here&ndash;&ndash;right here to the Forest
Queen,&rdquo; Santa F&eacute; said back to him. &ldquo;You
know pretty well I do things when I say I&rsquo;ll
do &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;and this thing&rsquo;ll be done! Come to
think of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;ll be better
if I go to your place and fetch her along myself.
It&rsquo;ll help if I do a little talking to her
on the way down. Yes, we&rsquo;ll fix it that way.
You and she be ready at four o&rsquo;clock, and
I&rsquo;ll come for you. That&rsquo;ll give her an hour
here, and an hour to go home and eat her
supper&ndash;&ndash;and that&rsquo;ll get us to train-time, and
then the circus&rsquo;ll close down. Now you go
home and go to bed, Bill. You&rsquo;re all beat
out. Just you leave things to Ike and me
and go right home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley wouldn&rsquo;t say another word&ndash;&ndash;so
Hart had one more drink, for luck, and then
he went home. He looked real relieved.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>When Santa F&eacute; went to Hart&rsquo;s place, next
afternoon, he had on his best black clothes,
with a clean shirt and a fresh white tie; and
he was that serious-looking you&rsquo;d have sized
him up for a sure-enough fire-escape anywhere
on sight. Hart hadn&rsquo;t had no trouble,
it turned out, keeping his aunt to home&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;d
been working double tides ever since
she got up, he said, making him things to
eat and fussing over his clothes. They was
all ready when Santa F&eacute; come along, and
the three of &rsquo;em stepped off down the track
together&ndash;&ndash;Hart having his aunt on his arm,
and Santa F&eacute; walking on ahead over the
ties. Most of the boys was standing about
watching the procession; but the girls&ndash;&ndash;the
Hen, likely, having told &rsquo;em to&ndash;&ndash;was keeping
on keeping quiet, and got what they could of
it peeping through chinks in the windows
and doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where <i>are</i> all the ladies, Mr.
Charles?&rdquo; Hart&rsquo;s aunt asked. &ldquo;Except that
sweet young wife of yours, it&rsquo;s just the
mortal truth I haven&rsquo;t seen a single lady
since I came into this town!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They usually keep in-doors at this time
of day, madam,&rdquo; Charley said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
attending to their domestic duties&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and
most of them, about now, are wont to be
enjoying the tenderest happiness of motherhood
in nursing their little babes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very creditable they&rsquo;re such good
housewives, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s aunt;
&ldquo;only I do wish I could have met some of
&rsquo;em and had a good dish of talk. But we&rsquo;ll
be finding your wife at the kindergarten, I
s&rsquo;pose, and I&rsquo;ll have the pleasure of a talk
with her. I&rsquo;ve been looking forward all day
to meeting her, Mr. Charles. She has one of
the very sweetest faces I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deeply regret to tell you, madam,&rdquo; said
Santa F&eacute;, &ldquo;that my wife was called away
suddenly last evening by a telegram. She
had no choice in the matter. Her call was
to minister to a sick relative in Denver, and
of course she left immediately on the night
train. Her disappointment at not meeting
you was great. She had set her heart on
showing you over our poor, half-ruined kindergarten&ndash;&ndash;the
fire did fearful damage&ndash;&ndash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
her duty was too manifest to be ignored, and
she had to leave that pleasant task to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that is just too bad!&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s
aunt. &ldquo;At least, Mr. Charles, I don&rsquo;t mean
that exactly. It&rsquo;s very kind of you to take
her place, and I&rsquo;m delighted to have you.
But I did so like your wife&rsquo;s looks, and I&rsquo;ve
been hoping she and I really&rsquo;d have a chance
to get to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That brought &rsquo;em to the Forest Queen,
and Charley was more&rsquo;n glad he was let out
from making more excuses why his wife had
shook her kindergarten job so sudden.
&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I must warn
you again, madam, that our little kindergarten
is only the ghost of what it was
before the fire. We are hoping to get a new
outfit shortly. On the very morning after
the disaster a subscription was started&ndash;&ndash;your
nephew, as always, leading in the good work&ndash;&ndash;and
that afternoon we telegraphed East
our order for fresh supplies. By the time
that the epidemic of whooping-cough has
abated&ndash;&ndash;I am glad to say that all the children
are doing well&ndash;&ndash;we trust that our flock of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
little ones again can troop gladly to receive
the elementary instruction that they delight
in, and that my wife delights to impart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s aunt, &ldquo;the kindergarten&rsquo;s
in Mrs. Major Rogers&rsquo; hotel&ndash;&ndash;the
Forest Queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the fire, Mrs. Major Rogers most
kindly gave us the free use of one of her
largest rooms,&rdquo; Santa F&eacute; said; &ldquo;and we are
installed here until our own building can be
repaired. I have spared you the sight,
madam, of that melancholy ruin. I confess
that when I look at it the tears come into
my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s
aunt. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d cry over it myself. But
what a real down good woman Mrs. Major
Rogers must be! Mr. Hill told me she gives
the Dorcas Society the use of a room, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a noble, high-toned lady, madam,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; said. &ldquo;Since her cruel bereavement
she has devoted to good works all the
time that she can spare from the arduous
duties by which she wins her livelihood.
Words fail me to say enough in her praise!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Come right in, madam&ndash;&ndash;but be prepared for
a sad surprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart said he didn&rsquo;t know how much surprised
his aunt was&ndash;&ndash;but he said when he
got inside the Forest Queen, into the bar-room
where Charley&rsquo;s faro layout usually was, he
was so surprised himself he felt as if he&rsquo;d
been kicked by a mule!</p>
<p>There was the little tables for drinks, right
enough; and out of the way in a corner with
a cloth over it, same as usual, was the wheel.
(It was used so little, the wheel was&ndash;&ndash;nobody
but Mexicans, now and then, caring for it&ndash;&ndash;Santa
F&eacute; owned up afterwards he&rsquo;d forgot it
clean!) That much of the place was just as
it always was; and the big table, taking up
half the room, looked so natural&ndash;&ndash;with the
chairs up to it, and layouts of chips at all
the places&ndash;&ndash;that Hart was beginning to think
Santa F&eacute; was setting up a rig on him: &rsquo;till he
seen what a lot of queer things besides chips
there was on the table&ndash;&ndash;and knowed they
wasn&rsquo;t no game layout, and so sized &rsquo;em up
to be what Charley&rsquo;d scrambled together
when he set out to play his kindergarten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
hand. And when he noticed the bar was
curtained off by sheets he said he stopped
worrying&ndash;&ndash;feeling dead certain Charley&rsquo;d
dealt himself all the aces he needed to take
him through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be told, madam, being
such an authority on kindergartens,&rdquo; said
Santa F&eacute;, &ldquo;how inadequate is our little outfit
for educational purposes. But you must
remember that the fire destroyed almost
everything, and that we have merely improvised
what will serve our purposes until the
new supply arrives. We succeeded in saving
from the conflagration our large table, and
our chairs, and most of the small tables&ndash;&ndash;used
by individual children having backward
intellects and needing especial care. But
nearly all of the other appliances of the school
were lost to us, and damage was done to much
of what we saved. Here, you see, is a little
table with only three legs left, the fourth
having been burned.&rdquo; And, sure enough,
Hart said, Santa F&eacute; turned up one of the
little tables for drinks and one of its legs <i>was</i>
burnt off! &ldquo;All of our slates,&rdquo; he went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
ahead, &ldquo;similarly were destroyed&ndash;&ndash;and how
much depends on slates in a kindergarten
you know, madam, better than I do. Here
is all that is left of one of them&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he
showed Hart&rsquo;s aunt a bit of burnt wood that
looked like it had been part of a slate-frame
afore it got afire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! Dear me!&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s aunt.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just pitiful, Mr. Charles! I wonder
how you can get along at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not easy getting along, madam,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; said. &ldquo;But we have managed to
supply ourselves with a layout&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;I
mean we have provided ourselves with
some of the simpler articles of most importance;
and with these, for the time being, we
keep our little pupils&rsquo; hands and minds not
unprofitably employed. For instance, the
ivory disks of various colors&ndash;&ndash;which you see
arranged upon the table as the pupils have
left them&ndash;&ndash;serve very successfully to elucidate
the arithmetical processes of numeration,
addition, and subtraction; and the
more intelligent children are taught to observe
that the disks of varying colors are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
varyingly numbered&ndash;&ndash;white, 1; red, 5, and
blue, 10&ndash;&ndash;and so are encouraged to identify
a concrete arbitrary figure with an abstract
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something new in kindergartening,
Mr. Charles,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s aunt; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s as
good as it can be. I mean to put it right
into use in our kindergarten at home. Do
you get the disks at the places where they
sell kindergarten supplies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, madam, I cannot tell you,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; said. &ldquo;You see, we ordered what
would be needed through an agent East, and
these came along. I must warn you, however,
that they are expensive,&rdquo; Hart said,
remembering what them chips
had cost him, one time and another, he
allowed to himself Charley was right and
they was about as expensive as they could
be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our other little appliances, madam,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; went on, &ldquo;are just our own makeshift
imitations of what you are familiar
with&ndash;&ndash;building-blocks, and alphabet-blocks,
and dissected pictures, and that sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
thing. Our local carpenter made the blocks
for us, and we put on the lettering ourselves&ndash;&ndash;as,
indeed, its poor quality shows. The
dissected pictures I am rather proud of, because
Mrs. Charles may be said to have
invented them.&rdquo; (It really was the Hen
who&rsquo;d made &rsquo;em, it turned out.) &ldquo;The
method is simple enough when you have
thought of it, of course&ndash;&ndash;and no doubt I
value my wife&rsquo;s work unduly because I take
so much pride in all that she does. You see,
she just pasted pictures from the illustrated
papers on boards; and then Mr. Williams&ndash;&ndash;our
carpenter, you know&ndash;&ndash;sawed the boards
into little pieces. And there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that <i>was</i> bright of her!&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s
aunt. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll put one of
the pictures together myself right now. I
want to see how it looks, made that home-fashioned
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that our time is getting a little
short, madam,&rdquo; said Santa F&eacute;, in a hurry.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my sermon to finish this afternoon,
and I must be going in a few minutes now.&rdquo;
The fact of the matter was he had to call her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
off quick. It seems the Hen hadn&rsquo;t had anything
but <i>Police Gazettes</i> to work on&ndash;&ndash;and
while the bits looked all right jumbled up,
being put together they wouldn&rsquo;t have suited
nohow at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I mustn&rsquo;t keep you,&rdquo; said
Hart&rsquo;s aunt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been more than kind,
Mr. Charles, to give me so much of your
valuable time as it is. I&rsquo;m just like a child
myself, wanting to play with dissected pictures
that way! But I must say that her
making them is a thing for your wife to be
proud of&ndash;&ndash;and I hope you&rsquo;ll tell her so for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better be going now, Aunt
Maria,&rdquo; Hart said. &ldquo;Mr. Charles has his
sermon to write, you know, and I want you
to have time to eat your supper comfortable
before we start down to the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do suppose we must go,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s
aunt. &ldquo;But I hate to, William, and that&rsquo;s
a fact! Just because it&rsquo;s so make-shifty,
this is the most interesting kindergarten I&rsquo;ve
ever been in. When I get home I shall really
and truly enjoy telling the folks about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
And I know how pleased they&rsquo;ll be, the same
as I am, by finding what earnest-working
men and women can do&ndash;&ndash;out here in this
rough country&ndash;&ndash;with so little to go on but
their wits and their own good hearts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she faced round sudden on
Santa F&eacute; and said: &ldquo;I see you have your
table covered with green, Mr. Charles.
What&rsquo;s that for? You&rsquo;ve so many good
notions about kindergartens that I&rsquo;d like to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, madam, that green cover
is a&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a sort of&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Charley went slow for
a minute, and then got a-hold of the card he
wanted and put it down as smooth as you
please. &ldquo;That is an invention, madam,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;of my good wife&rsquo;s, too. Out here,
where the sun is so violent, she said we must
have a green cover on the table or the glare
would be ruining all our dear little innocent
children&rsquo;s eyes. And it has worked, madam,
to a charm! Some of the children who had
bad eyes to start with actually have got
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do declare!&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s aunt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That wife of yours thinks so sensible she
just beats all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; give Hart a look as much as to
say he&rsquo;d got to get his aunt away somehow&ndash;&ndash;seeing
she was liable to break out a&rsquo;most
anywheres, and he&rsquo;d stood about all he could
stand. Hart allowed what Charley wanted
was reasonable, and he just grabbed her by
the arm and begun to lug her to the door.
But she managed to give Santa F&eacute; one more
jolt, and a bad one, before she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen what this is,&rdquo; she said;
and she broke off from Hart and went to
where the wheel was standing covered up in
the corner. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I may look at it, Mr.
Charles?&rdquo; she said&ndash;&ndash;and before either of &rsquo;em
could get a-hold of her to stop her she had
off the cloth. &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Whatever part of a kindergarten
have you got here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart said afterwards his heart went down
into his boots, being sure they&rsquo;d got to a give-away
of the worst sort. Santa F&eacute; said he
felt that way for a minute himself; then he
said he ciphered on it that Hart&rsquo;s aunt likely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
wouldn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;d struck&ndash;&ndash;and he
braced up and went ahead on that chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said&ndash;&ndash;speaking just as cool as
if he was calling the deal right among friends
at his own table&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that is one of the new
German kindergarten appliances that even
you, madam, may not have seen. We received
it as a present from a rich German
merchant in Pueblo, who was grieved by our
pitiable plight and wanted to do what he
could to help us after the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what in the name of common-sense,&rdquo;
said Hart&rsquo;s aunt, &ldquo;do you do with it&ndash;&ndash;with
all those numbers around in circles, and that
little ball?&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;&lsquo;ONE OF THE NEW GERMAN KINDERGARTEN APPLIANCES&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>Charley had himself in good shape by that
time, and he put down his words as sure as
if they was aces&ndash;&ndash;with more, if needed, up
his sleeve. &ldquo;It is used by our most advanced
class in arithmetic, madam,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The mechanism, you will observe, is arranged
to revolve&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he set it a-going&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;in
such a way that the small sphere also is put
in motion. And as the motion ceases&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;it
was slowing down to a stop&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the sphere
comes to rest on one of the numbers painted
legibly on either a black or a red ground.
The children, seated around the table, are
provided with the numerating disks to which
I have already called your attention; and&ndash;&ndash;with
a varying rapidity, regulated by their
individual intelligence&ndash;&ndash;they severally, as
promptly as possible, arrange their disks in
piles corresponding with the number indicated
by the purely fortuitous resting-place
of the sphere. The purpose of this ingenious
contrivance, as I scarcely need to point out
to you, is to combine the amusement of a
species of game with the mental stimulus
that the rapid computation of figures imparts.
I may add that we arouse a desirable
spirit of emulation among our little ones by
providing that the child who first correctly
arranges his disks to represent the indicated
figure is given&ndash;&ndash;until the game is concluded&ndash;&ndash;the
disks of the children whose calculation
has been slow, or at fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things in the world, Mr.
Charles,&rdquo; said Hart&rsquo;s aunt, &ldquo;to think of my
finding such a good thing as this out here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
in New Mexico&ndash;&ndash;when I&rsquo;ve time and again
been over the best kindergarten-supply places
in Boston, and have been reading all I could
lay my hands on about kindergartens for
twenty years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we do try not to be too primitive out
here, madam,&rdquo; said Santa F&eacute;, taking a long
breath over having got through all right;
&ldquo;and I am even vain enough to think that
perhaps we manage to keep pretty well up
with the times. But I must say that it is a
pleasant surprise to me to find that I have
been able to give more than one point to a
lady like you, who knows every card&ndash;&ndash;I
should say, to whom kindergarten processes
are so exceptionally well known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I really must beg your permission
to leave you, that I may return to my
sermon. I give much time to my sermons;
and I am cheered by the conviction&ndash;&ndash;you
must not think me boastful&ndash;&ndash;that it is time
well employed. When I look around me and
perceive the lawless, and even outrageous,
conditions which obtain in so many other
towns in the Territory, and contrast them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
with the orderly rectitude of Palomitas, I
rejoice that my humble toil in the vineyard
has brought so rich a reward. I deeply regret,
madam, that your present stay with us
must be so short; and with an equal earnestness
I hope that it may be my privilege soon
again to welcome you to our happy little
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hart&rsquo;s aunt&ndash;&ndash;she was just pleased all over&ndash;&ndash;was
beginning to make a speech back to
him; but Santa F&eacute; looked so wore out Hart
didn&rsquo;t give her the chance to go on. He just
grabbed her, and got her away in a hurry&ndash;&ndash;and
Charley went to fussing with the cover
of the wheel, putting it on again, so she
couldn&rsquo;t get at him to shake hands for good-bye.
He said afterwards he felt that weak,
when he fairly was shut of her, all he could
do was to flop down into a chair anyway and
sing out to Blister Mike to come and get the
sheets off the bar quick and give him his
own bottle of Bourbon and a tumbler. And
he said he never took so many drinks,
one right on top of another, since he was
born!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>There was more&rsquo;n the usual crowd down
at the deepo that night when the Denver
train pulled out&ndash;&ndash;with Hart&rsquo;s aunt in the
Pullman, and Hart standing on the Pullman
platform telling the boys up to the last minute
how much he was obliged.</p>
<p>Things went that same Sunday-school way
right on to the end of the game; and Hart
said his aunt told him&ndash;&ndash;as they was coming
along down to the deepo&ndash;&ndash;she never would
a-believed there could be such a town as
Palomitas was, out in that wild frontier
country, if she hadn&rsquo;t seen it with her own
eyes. As to the ladies of the town, he said
she told him they certainly was the most
domestic she&rsquo;d ever known!</p>
<p>Hart was so grateful&ndash;&ndash;and he had a right
to be&ndash;&ndash;he left a hunderd dollars with Tenderfoot
Sal and told her to blow off the town
for him that night by running a free bar.
Sal done it, right enough&ndash;&ndash;and that turned
out to be about the hottest night Palomitas
ever had. Most of the trouble was in the
dance-hall, where it was apt to be, and had
its start, as it did generally, right around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Sage-Brush Hen: who kept on being dressed
up in her white frock and wearing her white
sun-bonnet, and looked as demure as a cotton-tail
rabbit, and cut up so reckless I reckon
she about made a record for carryings on!
Santa F&eacute; had to fix one feller because of her&ndash;&ndash;shooting
him like he was used to, through
his pants-pocket&ndash;&ndash;and more&rsquo;n a dozen got
hurt in the ordinary way.</p>
<p>Some of the shooting didn&rsquo;t seem quite as
if it was needed; but it was allowed afterwards&ndash;&ndash;even
if there hadn&rsquo;t been no free bar&ndash;&ndash;there
was excuse for it: seeing the town
was all strung up and had to work itself off.
Santa F&eacute;, of course, had more excuse than
anybody, being most strung-upest. Bluffing
his way through that kindergarten game, he
said, was the biggest strain he&rsquo;d ever had.
But he didn&rsquo;t mind what trouble he&rsquo;d took,
he said, seeing he&rsquo;d got Hart out of his hole
by taking it; and he looked real pleased when
Hill spoke up&ndash;&ndash;just about voicing what all
the rest of us was thinking&ndash;&ndash;saying he
was ready, after the way he&rsquo;d played his
kindergarten hand, to put his pile on Santa
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
F&eacute; Charley to make iced drinks in
hell!</p>
<p>Of course Hill oughtn&rsquo;t to have spoke like
that. But allowances was to be made for
Hill&ndash;&ndash;owing to the ways he&rsquo;d got into driving
mules.</p>

<h3>BOSTON&rsquo;S LION-HUNT</h3>
</div>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, folks in Palomitas
mostly got for names what
happened to come handiest
and fitted. Likely that dude&rsquo;s
cuffs was marked with something
he was knowed by; but as most of us
wasn&rsquo;t particular what his cuffs was marked,
or him either, we just called him Boston&ndash;&ndash;after
the town he made out he belonged to&ndash;&ndash;and
let it go at that. Big game was what he
said he was looking for: and Santa F&eacute;
Charley, with Shorty Smith and others helping,
saw to it he got all he wanted and some
over&ndash;&ndash;but I reckon the exercises would a-been
less spirited if the Sage-Brush Hen
hadn&rsquo;t chipped in and played a full hand.</p>
<p>He was one of the sporting kind, Boston
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
was, that turned up frequent in the Territory
in them days. Most of &rsquo;em was friends
of officers at some of the posts, with a sprinkling
throwed in of sons and nephews of
directors of the road. Big game was what
they all made out they come for; and they
was apt to have about as much use for big
game&ndash;&ndash;when they happened to find any&ndash;&ndash;as
a cat has for two tails. But they seemed
to enjoy letting off ca&rsquo;tridges&ndash;&ndash;and used to
buy what skins was in the market to take
home.</p>
<p>Boston turned out to be a nephew&ndash;&ndash;nephews
was apt to be worse&rsquo;n sons for stuck-upness&ndash;&ndash;and
he come in one morning in a
private car hitched onto the Denver train.
He had a colored man along to cook and
clean his guns for him&ndash;&ndash;he had more things
to shoot with, and of more shapes and sizes,
than you ever seen in one place outside of a
gun-store&ndash;&ndash;and he was dressed that nice in
green corduroys, with new-fangled knives and
hunting fixings hanging all over him like he
was a Christmas-tree, he might have hired
out for a show. He wasn&rsquo;t a bad set-up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
young feller; but with them green clothes
on, and being clean shaved and wearing
eye-glasses, he did look just about what he
truly was.</p>
<p>Wood had a wire a director&rsquo;s nephew was
coming&ndash;&ndash;he was the agent, Wood was&ndash;&ndash;and
orders to side-track his car and see he was
took care of; and of course Wood passed the
word along to the rest of us what sort of a
game was on. But he begged so hard, Wood
did, the town would hold itself in&ndash;&ndash;saying if
rigs was put up on a director&rsquo;s nephew he
was dead sure to lose his job&ndash;&ndash;we all allowed
we&rsquo;d give the young feller a day or two to
turn round in, anyway; and we promised
Wood&ndash;&ndash;who was liked&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;d let the critter
get through his hunting picnic without putting
up no rigs on him if he made any sort
of a show of knowing how to behave. Howsomedever,
he didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;and things started up,
and nobody but Boston himself to blame for
it, that very first night over in the bar-room
at the Forest Queen.</p>
<p>He had Wood in to supper with him in his
car, Boston did, the darky cooking it; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Wood said&ndash;&ndash;except it begun with their having
pickled green plums, and some sort of
messed-up stuff that tasted like spoilt salt
fish and made him feel sickish&ndash;&ndash;it was the
best supper he ever eat. Each of &rsquo;em had
a bottle of iced wine, he said; and he said
they topped off with coffee that only wanted
milk to make it a real wonder, and a drink
like rock-and-rye, but chalks better, and such
seegars as he&rsquo;d never smoked in his born
days.</p>
<p>All the time they was hashing&ndash;&ndash;and Wood
said he reckoned they was at it a&rsquo;most a
full hour&ndash;&ndash;Boston kept a-telling what a hell
of a one (that was the sort of careless way
Wood put it) he was at big-game hunting;
but Wood judged&ndash;&ndash;taking all his talk together&ndash;&ndash;the
only thing he&rsquo;d ever really shot
bigger&rsquo;n a duck or a pa&rsquo;tridge was a deer
the dogs had chased into a pond for him so
it hadn&rsquo;t no chance. But it wasn&rsquo;t none of
Wood&rsquo;s business to stop a director&rsquo;s nephew
from blowing if he felt like it, and so he just
let him fan away. Bears wasn&rsquo;t bad sport,
he said, and he didn&rsquo;t mind filling in time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
with &rsquo;em if he couldn&rsquo;t get nothing better;
but what he&rsquo;d come to Palomitas for &rsquo;special,
he said, was mountain-lions&ndash;&ndash;he seemed to
have it in his head he&rsquo;d find &rsquo;em walking all
over the place, same as cats&ndash;&ndash;and he wanted
to know if any&rsquo;d lately been seen.</p>
<p>Wood told him them animals wasn&rsquo;t met
with frequent in them parts (and they wasn&rsquo;t,
for a fact, and hadn&rsquo;t been for about a hunderd
years, likely) and maybe he&rsquo;d do better
to set his mind on jack-rabbits&ndash;&ndash;which there
was enough of out in the sage-brush, Wood
told him, to load his car. And then he
looked so real down disappointed, seeming
to think jack-rabbits wasn&rsquo;t anyways satisfactory,
Wood said he told him there was
chances some of the boys over at the Forest
Queen&ndash;&ndash;they being all the time out in the
mountains looking for prospects&ndash;&ndash;might put
him on to finding a bear, anyway; and it
wouldn&rsquo;t do no harm to go across to the
Queen and ask. And so over the both of
&rsquo;em come.</p>
<p>It was Wood&rsquo;s mistake bringing that green-corduroyed
pill right in among the boys without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
giving notice, and Wood owned up it was
later&ndash;&ndash;allowing he&rsquo;d a-been more careful if
the rock-and-rye stuff on top of the wine, not
being used to either of &rsquo;em, hadn&rsquo;t loaded
him more&rsquo;n he knowed about at the time.
Boston didn&rsquo;t seem to be much loaded, likely
having the habit of taking such drinks and
so being able to carry &rsquo;em; but he was that
high-horsey&ndash;&ndash;putting on his eye-glasses and
staring &rsquo;round the place same as if he&rsquo;d
struck a menagerie and the boys was beasts
in cages&ndash;&ndash;all hands was set spiteful to him
right off.</p>
<p>Things was running about as usual at the
Queen: most of the boys setting around the
table and Santa F&eacute; dealing; a few of &rsquo;em
standing back of the others looking on; two
or three getting drinks at the bar and talking
to Blister; and the girls kicking their
heels on the benches, waiting till it come
time to start up dancing in the other room.
The only touch out of the common was the
way the Sage-Brush Hen had fixed herself&ndash;&ndash;she
being rigged up in the same white duds
she&rsquo;d wore when Hart&rsquo;s aunt come to town,
and looking so real cute and pretty in &rsquo;em,
and acting demure to suit, nobody&rsquo;d ever
a-sized her for the gay old licketty-split Hen
she was.</p>

&ldquo;STARING &rsquo;ROUND THE PLACE SAME AS IF HE&rsquo;D STRUCK A MENAGERIE&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>It was between deals when Wood and
Boston come in, and Santa F&eacute; got up from
the table and crossed over to &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;Charley
always was that polite you&rsquo;d a-thought he
was a fish-hook with pants on&ndash;&ndash;and told
Boston he hoped he seen him well, and was
glad he&rsquo;d come along. Then Wood told how
he was after mountain-lions, and wasn&rsquo;t likely
to get none; and Charley owned up they was
few, and what there was of &rsquo;em was so sort
of scattered the chances for finding &rsquo;em was
poor.</p>
<p>Boston didn&rsquo;t say much of nothing at first,
seeming to be took up with trying to make
out where Santa F&eacute; belonged to&ndash;&ndash;hitching on
his eye-glasses and looking him over careful,
but only getting puzzleder the more he stared.
You see, Charley&ndash;&ndash;in them black clothes and
a white tie on&ndash;&ndash;looked for certain sure like
he was a minister; and there he was getting
up red-hot from dealing faro, and having on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
each side of where he set at the table a forty-five
gun. It was more of a mix-up than
Boston could manage, and you could see he
didn&rsquo;t know where he was at. Howsomedever,
Wood had told him he&rsquo;d better make
out to be friendly, and take just what happened
to come along without asking no
questions; and I reckon the shoat really
meant, as well as he knowed how to, to do
what he was told. So he give up trying to
size Santa F&eacute;, and said back to him he was
obliged and was feeling hearty; and then he
took to grinning, like as if he wanted to
make things pleasant, and says: &ldquo;Really, I
am very much interested in my surroundings.
This place has quite the air of being a
barbarian Monte Carlo. It really has, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a non-plusser for Charley&ndash;&ndash;and
Santa F&eacute; wasn&rsquo;t non-plustered often, and
didn&rsquo;t like it when he was&ndash;&ndash;but he pulled
himself together and put down what cards
he had: telling Boston monte was a game
he sometimes played with friends for amusement&ndash;&ndash;which
was the everlasting truth, only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the friends mostly was less amused than he
was&ndash;&ndash;and he&rsquo;d had a dog named Carlo, he
said, when he was a boy.</p>
<p>Boston seemed to think that was funny,
and took to snickering sort of superior. He
was about a full dose for uppishness, that
young feller was: going on as if he&rsquo;d bought
the Territory, and as if the folks in it was
the peones he&rsquo;d took over&ndash;&ndash;Mexican fashion&ndash;&ndash;along
with the land. Then he said he guessed
Santa F&eacute; did not ketch his meaning, and
Monte Carlo was the biggest gambling hell
there was.</p>
<p>Being in the business, Santa F&eacute; was apt
to get peevish when anybody took to talking
about gambling; and Boston&rsquo;s throwing in
hell on top of it that way was more&rsquo;n he
cared to stand. He didn&rsquo;t let on&ndash;&ndash;at least
not so the fool could see it&ndash;&ndash;his dander was
started, setting on himself being one of the
things his work trained him to; but the boys
noticed he begun to get palish up at the top
of his forehead&ndash;&ndash;where there was a white
streak between his hair and where his hat
come&ndash;&ndash;and all hands knowed that for a bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
sign. Boston, of course&ndash;&ndash;being strangers
with him&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t know what Charley&rsquo;s signs
was; and he just kept on a-talking as fresh
as his green clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not less psychologically than sociologically,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;is it interesting to find in
this slum of the wilderness the degenerate
Old-World vices in crude New-World garb.
Here,&rdquo; says he, jerking his head across to
the table, &ldquo;is a coarse reproduction of Monaco&rsquo;s
essence; and there, I observe, are other
repulsive features equally coarse&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he
jerked his head over to where Shorty Smith
was setting up drinks for Carrots at the
bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dare to say one word more about
my features, young man,&rdquo; says Carrots&ndash;&ndash;having
a pug-nose, Carrots was techy about
her features; and she had a temper the same
color as her hair&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smack you in the
mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Oi&rsquo;ll smack your whole domn head
off!&rdquo; put in Blister Mike. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you think
Oi&rsquo;m going to have ladies drinking at my
bar insulted by slush like you?&rdquo; And Blister
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
reached down to where he kept it among the
tumblers to get his gun.</p>
<p>It looked as if there was going to be a
ruction right off. There was Carrots red-hotter
than her hair; and Blister, who was
special friends with Carrots, shooting mad
at having anybody sassing her; and Santa
F&eacute;&rsquo;s forehead getting whiter and whiter; and
all hands on their hind legs at having Palomitas
called a slum of the wilderness&ndash;&ndash;and
likely worse things said about the place in
words nobody&rsquo;d ever heard tell of longer&rsquo;n
your arm. The only one keeping quiet was
Wood. He was sure, Wood was, trouble
was coming beyond his stopping; and as he
knowed which side his bread was buttered,
and how he&rsquo;d be fired from his job if things
happened to go serious, he just went and sat
down in a corner and swore to himself sorrowful,
and was about the miserablest-looking
man you ever seen alive. I guess it
was more&rsquo;n anything else being pitiful for
Wood made things take the turn they did
when the Sage-Brush Hen come into the
game.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you all hear <i>me</i>!&rdquo; the Hen sung out
sudden&ndash;&ndash;and as the Hen wasn&rsquo;t much given
to no such public speaking, and the boys was
used to doing quick what she wanted when
she asked for it, everybody stopped talking
and Blister put his gun down on the bar.
Most of us, I reckon, had a feeling the Hen
was going to let things out in some queer
way she&rsquo;d thought of in that funny head of
hers&ndash;&ndash;same as she&rsquo;d done other times when
matters was getting serious&ndash;&ndash;and we all was
ready to help her with any skylarking she
was up to that would put a stop to the
rumpus and so get Wood out of his hole.
As for Boston&ndash;&ndash;being too much of a fool to
know what he&rsquo;d done to start such a racket&ndash;&ndash;he
was all mazed-up by it: staring straight
ahead of him like a horse with staggers, and
looking like he wished he&rsquo;d never been
born.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all hear <i>me</i>, I tell you!&rdquo; says the
Hen, taking a-hold of Boston&rsquo;s arm sort of
motherly. &ldquo;While I am the school-teacher
in Palomitas I shall not permit you boys to
play your pranks on strangers; and &rsquo;specially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
not on this gentleman&ndash;&ndash;whom I claim as a
friend of mine because we both come from
the same dear old town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the first time anybody&rsquo;d ever
heard the Hen wasn&rsquo;t hatched-out in Kansas
City. But it didn&rsquo;t seem as if calling
her hand would be gentlemanly, so nobody
said nothing; and off she went again&ndash;&ndash;talking
this time to Boston, but winking the eye
away from him at the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is merely a joke, sir,&rdquo; says the Hen,
&ldquo;that these young men are playing on you&ndash;&ndash;and
as silly a joke as silly can be. Sometimes,
in spite of my most earnest efforts to
stop them, they will go on in this foolish
way: pretending to be wild and wicked and
murderous and all such nonsense, when in
reality there is not a single one among them
who willingly would hurt a fly. What Miss
Mortimer said about smacking you, as I
hardly need to explain, was a joke too.
Dear Miss Mortimer! She is as full of fun
as a kitten, and as sweet and gentle&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Carrots,
not seeing what the Hen was driving
at, all the time was looking like a red-headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
thunder-storm&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;as the kindest-hearted kitten
that ever was!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, I assure you, sir, this reprehensible
practical joking&ndash;&ndash;for which I beg
your indulgence&ndash;&ndash;definitely is ended; and I
am glad to promise that you will find in
evidence, during the remainder of your stay
in Palomitas, only the friendliness and the
courtesy which truly are the essential characteristics
of our seemingly turbulent little
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hen stopped for a minute to get her
wind back&ndash;&ndash;which give the boys a chance
to study over what they was told they was,
and what kind of a town it turned out to be
they was living in&ndash;&ndash;and then off she went
again, saying: &ldquo;I beg that you will pardon
me, sir, for addressing you so informally,
without waiting for an introduction. We
do not always stand strictly on etiquette
here in Palomitas; and I saw that I had to
put my cards down quick&ndash;&ndash;I mean that I
had to intervene hurriedly&ndash;&ndash;to save you
from being really annoyed. Now that I have
cleared up the trifling misunderstanding, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
trust satisfactorily, we will go back to where
we ought to have started and I will ask Mr.
Charles to introduce us.&rdquo; And round she
cracked to Santa F&eacute; and says: &ldquo;Will you be
so kind as to introduce my fellow-townsman
to me, Mr. Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; had begun to get a little cooled
off by that time; and, like as not&ndash;&ndash;it was a
wonder the way them two passed cards to
each other&ndash;&ndash;the Hen give him some sort of
a look that made him suspicion what her
game was. Anyway, into it he come&ndash;&ndash;saying
to Boston, talking high-toned and polite
like he knowed how to: &ldquo;I have much
pleasure, sir, in presenting you to Miss Sage,
who is Palomitas&rsquo;s idol&ndash;&ndash;and a near relative,
as you may be interested in knowing, of the
eminent Eastern capitalist of the same name.
As she herself has mentioned, Miss Sage is
our school-teacher; but her modest cheek
would be suffused with blushes were I to tell
you how much more she is to us&ndash;&ndash;how broadly
her generous nature prompts her to construe
her duties as the instructress of innocent
youth. Only a moment ago you had an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
opportunity for observing that her word is
our law paramount. I am within bounds in
saying, sir, that in Palomitas she is universally
adored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Charles! How can you!&rdquo; says
the Hen, kind of turning away and looking
as if what Charley&rsquo;d said really had made
her feel like blushing a little. Then she
faced round again and shook hands with
Boston&ndash;&ndash;who was so rattled he seemed only
about half awake, and done it like a pump&ndash;&ndash;and
says to him: &ldquo;Mr. Charles is a born flatterer
if ever there was one, sir, and you must
pay no attention whatever to his extravagant
words. I only try in my poor way, as
occasion presents itself&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she let her voice
drop down so it went sort of soft and ketchy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to
mollify some of the harsher asperities
of our youthfully strenuous community; to
apply, as it were, the touchstone of Boston
social standards&ndash;&ndash;the standards that you and
I, sir, recognize&ndash;&ndash;to the sometimes too rough
ways of our rough little frontier settlement.
It is true, though, and I am proud to say it,
that the boys do like me&ndash;&ndash;of course Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Charles&rsquo;s talk about my being an idol and
adored is only his nonsense; and it is true
that they always are nice about doing what
I ask them to do&ndash;&ndash;as they were just now,
when they were naughty and I had to make
them behave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, since the formalities have been
attended to and we have been introduced
properly, and since you and I are fellow-Bostonians
and ought to be friendly&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
Hen give him one of them fetching looks of
hers&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you must come over to the bar and
have a drink on me. And while we are performing
this rite of hospitality,&rdquo; says the
Hen&ndash;&ndash;pretending not to see the jump he give&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we
can discuss your projected lion-hunt:
in which, with your permission, I shall take
part.&rdquo; Boston give a bigger jump at that;
and the Hen says on to him, sort of explaining
matters: &ldquo;You need not fear that I shall
not sustain my end of the adventure. As
any of the boys here will tell you, I can handle
a forty-five or a Winchester about as well as
anybody&ndash;&ndash;and big-game hunting really is my
forte. Indeed, I may say&ndash;&ndash;using one of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
homely but expressive colloquialisms&ndash;&ndash;that
when it comes to lion-hunting I am simply
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boston seemed to be getting worse and
worse mixed while the Hen was rattling her
stuff off to him&ndash;&ndash;and I reckon, all things considered,
he wasn&rsquo;t to be blamed. He&rsquo;d got
a jolt to start with, when he come in and
found what he took to be a preacher dealing
faro; and he was worse jolted when his fool-talk&ndash;&ndash;and
he not knowing how he&rsquo;d done it&ndash;&ndash;run
him so close up against a shooting-scrape.
But the Hen was the limit: she
looking and acting like the school-ma&rsquo;am she
said she was, and yet tangled up in a bar-room
with a lot of gamblers and such as
Kerosene Kate and old Tenderfoot Sal and
Carrots&ndash;&ndash;and then bringing the two ends
together by talking one minute like he was
used to East, and the next one wanting to
set up drinks for him and telling him she
knowed all there was to know about gun-handling
and how at lion-hunting she was
just hell! I guess he was more&rsquo;n half excusable,
that young feller was, for looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
like he couldn&rsquo;t be counted on for telling for
certain on which end of him was his heels!</p>
<p>What he did manage to work out clear in
that fool head of his was he had the chance
to get the drink he needed, and needed bad,
to brace him; so over he come with the Hen
to the bar and got it&ndash;&ndash;and it seemed to do
him some good. Then Carrots&ndash;&ndash;who&rsquo;d begun
to ketch on a little to what the Hen was
after&ndash;&ndash;spoke up and told him it was true
what Miss Sage had told him about her
kittenishness, and she hadn&rsquo;t meant nothing
when she was talking about smacking him;
and to show he had no hard feeling, she said,
he must have one on her. Then Blister
Mike, having sized matters up, chipped in
too: saying it would make him feel comfortabler&ndash;&ndash;having
done some joking himself
by talking the way he did and getting his
gun out&ndash;&ndash;if they&rsquo;d all have one on the bar.</p>
<p>As drinks in Palomitas was sighted for a
thousand yards, and carried to kill further,
by the time Boston had three of &rsquo;em in him&ndash;&ndash;on
top of the ones he&rsquo;d had with Wood at
supper&ndash;&ndash;he was loaded enough to be careless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
about what was happening among the sunspots
and ready to take things pretty much
as they come along. The boys was ready
for what might be coming too: allowing for
sure the Hen was getting a circus started,
and only waiting to follow suit to the cards
she put down.</p>
<p>What was needed, it turned out, was
stacked with Shorty Smith; and the Hen
sort of picked up Shorty with her eyes and
says to him: &ldquo;Your little boy Gustavus&ndash;&ndash;he
is <i>such</i> a dear little fellow, and I do love him
so!&ndash;&ndash;was telling me at recess to-day, Mr.
Smith, that you saw a lion when you were
out in the mountains day before yesterday
prospecting. I think that very likely you
may have seen the fierce creature even more
recently; and perhaps you will have the
kindness to tell us&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Hen winked her
off eye at Shorty to show him what was
wanted&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;where he probably may be found
at the present time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the boys couldn&rsquo;t help snickering
right out when the Hen took to loading up
Shorty with little Gustavuses; but Boston
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
didn&rsquo;t notice nothing, and Shorty&ndash;&ndash;who had
wits as sharp as pin-points, and could be
counted on for what cards was needed in the
kind of game the Hen was playing&ndash;&ndash;put down
the ace she asked for and never turned a hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustavus will be tickled out of his little
boots, Miss,&rdquo; says Shorty, &ldquo;when I tell him
how nice you&rsquo;ve spoke about him; and I&rsquo;m
much obliged myself. He give it to you
straight, the kid did, about that lion. I seen
him, all right&ndash;&ndash;and so close up it most scared
the life out of me! And you&rsquo;re right, Miss,
in thinking I&rsquo;ve ketched onto him since&ndash;&ndash;seeing
I was a blame sight nearer to him than
I wanted to be less&rsquo;n four hours ago. Yes,
ma&rsquo;am, as I was coming in home to-night
from the Ca&ntilde;ada I struck that animal&rsquo;s tracks
in the mud down by the ford back of the
deepo&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d been down to the river for a
drink, I reckon&ndash;&ndash;and they was so fresh he
couldn&rsquo;t a-been more&rsquo;n five minutes gone.
When I got to thinking what likely might
a-happened if I&rsquo;d come along them five
minutes sooner, Miss, I had cold creeps crawling
all up and down the spine of my back!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>Them statements of Shorty&rsquo;s set the boys
to snickering some more&ndash;&ndash;there not being no
ford on the Rio Grande this side of La Chamita,
and the wagon-bridge being down back
of the deepo where he said his ford was&ndash;&ndash;but
Shorty paid no attention, and went on as
smooth as if he was speaking a piece he&rsquo;d
got by heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know, Miss, being such a hunter,&rdquo;
says he&ndash;&ndash;making up what happened to be
wanted about lions, same as he&rsquo;d done about
fords&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;them animals takes a drink every
four hours in the night-time as regular as if
they looked at their watches. Likely that
feller&rsquo;s bedded just a little way back in the
chaparral so&rsquo;s to be handy for his next one;
and I reckon if this sport here feels he needs
lions&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Shorty give his head a jerk over to
Boston&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll get one by looking for it right
now. But for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, Miss, don&rsquo;t
you think of taking a hand in tackling him!
He&rsquo;s a most a-terrible big one&ndash;&ndash;the out and
out biggest I ever seen. The first thing you
knowed about it, he&rsquo;d a-gulped you down
whole!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How you do go on, Mr. Smith!&rdquo; says the
Hen, laughing pleasant. &ldquo;Have you so soon
forgotten our hunt together last winter&ndash;&ndash;when
I came up and shot the grizzly in the
ear just as he had you down and was beginning
to claw you? And are you not ashamed
of yourself, after that, to say that any lion
is too big for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without stopping for Shorty to strain
himself trying to remember that bear-hunt,
round she cracked to Boston&ndash;&ndash;giving Shorty
and Santa F&eacute; a chance to get in a corner and
talk quick in a whisper&ndash;&ndash;and says to him:
&ldquo;We just <i>are</i> in luck! These big old ones
are the real fighters, you know. Only a
year ago there was a gentleman from the
East here on a lion-hunt&ndash;&ndash;it was his first,
and he did not seem to know quite how to
manage matters&ndash;&ndash;and one of these big fierce
ones caught him and finished him. It was
very horrible! The dreadful creature sprang
on him in the dark and almost squeezed him
to death, and then tore him to pieces while
he still was alive enough to feel it, and ended
by eating so much of him that only a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
scraps of him were left to send East to his
friends. This one seems to be just that
kind. Isn&rsquo;t it splendid! What superb sport
we shall have in getting him&ndash;&ndash;you and I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the Hen had to say about the way
lions done business&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;specially their eating
hunters like they was sandwiches on a free-lunch
counter&ndash;&ndash;seemed to take some of the
load off Boston, and as he got soberer he
wasn&rsquo;t so careless as he&rsquo;d been. From his
looks it was judged he was thinking a lion
some sizes smaller would be a better fit for
him; but he couldn&rsquo;t well say so&ndash;&ndash;with the
Hen going on about wanting hers as big as
they made &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;so he took a brace, and sort
of swelled himself out, and said the bigger
this one was the better he&rsquo;d be pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot permit you, my dear young
lady,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to share with me the great
danger incident to pursuing so ferocious a
creature. I alone must deal with it. To-morrow
I shall familiarize myself with the
locality where Mr. Smith has found its tracks;
and to-morrow night, or the night after&ndash;&ndash;as
the weather may determine. Of course nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
can be done in case of rain&ndash;&ndash;I will seek
the savage brute in its lair. And then we
shall find out&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Boston worked up as much
as he could of a grin, but it seemed to come
hard and didn&rsquo;t fit well&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;which of us shall
have the other&rsquo;s skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger for me!&rdquo; says the Hen, giving
him another of them looks of hers. &ldquo;Just
as though I would not be as safe, with a brave
man like you to protect me, as I am teaching
school! And to-morrow night, indeed! Do
you think lions are like dentists&ndash;&ndash;only the
other way round about the teeth!&rdquo; and the
Hen laughed hearty&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and you can make
appointments with them a week ahead!
Why, we must be off, you and I, this very
minute! I&rsquo;ll run right round home and get
my rifle&ndash;&ndash;and meet you at your car as soon
as you&rsquo;ve got yours. To think of our having
a lion this way almost sitting on the front-door
step! It&rsquo;s a chance that won&rsquo;t come
again in a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away the Hen went a-kiting; and, there
not being no hole he could see to crawl out
of, away went Boston&ndash;&ndash;only the schedule he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
run on was some miles less to the hour. To
make sure he didn&rsquo;t try to side-track, Shorty
went with him&ndash;&ndash;leaving Santa F&eacute; to fix
matters with the Hen, and do what talking
was needed to ring in the boys.</p>
<p>Shorty put through his part in good shape:
helping Boston get as many of his guns as
he thought was wanted to hunt lions with&ndash;&ndash;which
was as many as he could pack along
with him&ndash;&ndash;and managing sort of casual to
slip out the ca&rsquo;tridges, so he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt
nobody. It turned out Shorty needn&rsquo;t a-been
so extry-precautious&ndash;&ndash;but of course he
couldn&rsquo;t tell. By the time Shorty had him
ready, the Hen come a-hustling up&ndash;&ndash;having
finished settling things with Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and
sung out to him to get a move on, or likely
the lion would a-had his drink and gone.
The move he got wasn&rsquo;t much of a one; but
he did come a-creeping out of the car at
last, and having such a load of weepons
on him as give him some excuse for going
slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you!&rdquo; says Shorty, and off
he skipped in a hurry to get at the rest of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
part of the ceremonies&ndash;&ndash;not paying no attention
to Boston&rsquo;s most getting down on his
knees to him begging him to come along.
Then Boston wanted the colored man to come&ndash;&ndash;who
was scared out of his black skin at the
notion, and wouldn&rsquo;t; and if the Hen hadn&rsquo;t
ended up by grabbing a-hold of him&ndash;&ndash;saying
as it was dark, and she knowed the way and
he didn&rsquo;t, she&rsquo;d better lead him&ndash;&ndash;likely she
wouldn&rsquo;t a-got him started at all. Pulling
him was more like what she did than leading
him, the Hen said afterwards; but she didn&rsquo;t
kick about his going slow and wanting to
stop every minute, she said, because it give
Santa F&eacute; and Shorty more time.</p>
<p>The night was the kind that&rsquo;s usual in New
Mexico, and just what was wanted. There
was no moon, and the starshine&ndash;&ndash;all the
stars looked to be about the size of cheeses&ndash;&ndash;give
a hazy sort of light that made everything
seem twice as big as it really was, and
shadows so black and solid you&rsquo;d think you
could cut &rsquo;em in slices same as pies. And
it was so still you could a-heard a mouse
sneezing half a mile off. The rattling all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
over him of Boston&rsquo;s weepons sounded like
there was boilers getting rivetted close by.</p>
<p>The Hen yanked him along easy, but kept
him a-moving&ndash;&ndash;and passed the time for him
by telling all she could make up about what
desprit critters lions was. Starting from
where his car was side-tracked, they went
round the deepo; and then down the wagon-road
pretty near to the bridge, but not so
near he could see it; and then across through
the sage-brush and clumps of mesquite till
they come to the river&ndash;&ndash;where there was a
break in the bluff, and a flat place going on
down into the water that looked like it was
the beginning of a ford. For a fact, it was
where the Mexican women come to do their
clothes-washing, and just back from the
river was a little &rsquo;dobe house&ndash;&ndash;flat-topped,
and the size and shape of a twelve-foot-square
dry-goods box&ndash;&ndash;the women kept
their washing things in. But them was particulars
the Hen didn&rsquo;t happen to mention to
Boston at the time.</p>
<p>When they come to the &rsquo;dobe she give him
a jerk, to show him he was to stand still there;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
and then she grabbed him close up to her, so
she could whisper, and says: &ldquo;It was here
that Mr. Smith saw the ferocious animal&rsquo;s
foot-marks almost precisely four hours ago.
The habits of these creatures are so regular,
as Mr. Smith mentioned, that this one certainly
will return for his next drink when
the four hours are ended&ndash;&ndash;and so may be
upon us at any moment. I hope that we
may see him coming. If he saw us before
we saw him&ndash;&ndash;well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be nice at
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hen let that soak in a little; and then
she snuggled up to Boston, all sort of shivery,
and says: &ldquo;I wish that we had taken the
precaution to ask Mr. Smith from which
direction the tracks came. These lions, you
know, have a dreadful way of stealing up
close to you and then springing! That was
what happened to that poor young man.
So far as was known, his first notice of his
peril was finding himself crushed to the
ground beneath the creature&rsquo;s weight&ndash;&ndash;and
the next instant it was tearing him with its
teeth and claws. I&ndash;&ndash;I begin to wish I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
hadn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; And the Hen snuggled up
closer and shivered bad.</p>
<p>Boston seemed to be doing some shivers on
his own account, judging from the way his
guns rattled; and his teeth was so chattery
his talking come queer. But he managed to
get out that if they was inside the house
they&rsquo;d have more chances&ndash;&ndash;and he went to
work trying to open the door. When he
found he couldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;it being locked so good
there was no budging it&ndash;&ndash;he got worse jolted,
and his breath seemed to be coming hard.</p>
<p>The Hen got a-hold of him again and
done some more shivers, and then she says:
&ldquo;It all will be over, one way or the other, in
a very few moments now. And oh, how
thankful I am&ndash;&ndash;since so needlessly and so
foolishly I have placed myself in this deadly
peril&ndash;&ndash;that I have for my protector a brave
man! If salvation is possible, you will save
me I am sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boston tried to say something, but he&rsquo;d
got so he was beyond talking and only gagged;
and while he was a-gagging there come a
queer noise&ndash;&ndash;sounding like it was a critter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
crawling around in among the bushes&ndash;&ndash;that
made him most jump out of his skin! Down
went his guns on the ground all in a clatter;
and he was scared so limp he&rsquo;d a-gone down
a-top of &rsquo;em if the Hen hadn&rsquo;t got a good grip
on him with both arms. They stood that
way more&rsquo;n a minute, with him a-shaking all
over and the Hen doing some shaking for
company&ndash;&ndash;and then she hiked him round so
he pointed right and says: &ldquo;Look! Look!
There by those little bushes! Oh how horrible!&rdquo;
And the Hen give a groan.</p>
<p>What was wanted to be looked at was on
hand, right enough&ndash;&ndash;and I reckon it showed
to most advantage by about as much light as
it got from the stars. All they could make
sure of was something alive, moving sort of
awkward and jumpy, coming out from a
tangle of mesquite bushes not more&rsquo;n three
rods off and heading straight for &rsquo;em; and
seeing it the way they did&ndash;&ndash;just a black
splotch all mixed in with the shadows of the
bushes&ndash;&ndash;it looked to be most as big as a cow!
Limp as he was&ndash;&ndash;so you&rsquo;d a-thought there
wasn&rsquo;t any yell in him&ndash;&ndash;Boston let off a yell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
that likely was heard clear across the mesa
at San Juan!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; says the Hen. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m
too frightened. Shoot quick&ndash;&ndash;or we are
lost!&rdquo; She let go of him, so he could reach
down to where he&rsquo;d spilled his gun-shop and
get a weepon; but Boston wasn&rsquo;t on the shoot,
and he hadn&rsquo;t no use for weepons just then.
All he wanted to do was to run; and if the
Hen hadn&rsquo;t got a fresh grip on him and held
him&ndash;&ndash;she was a strapping strong woman, the
Hen was&ndash;&ndash;he would a-made a bolt for it
certain sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Don&rsquo;t attempt to run!&rdquo; says
the Hen, talking scared and desprit. &ldquo;In
an instant, should we turn our backs on him,
the terrible creature would be upon us with
one long cruel bound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the way the terrible creature, as the
Hen called him, was a-going on&ndash;&ndash;sort of
hopping up and down, and not making much
headway&ndash;&ndash;it didn&rsquo;t look as if long cruel
bounds was what he was most used to. But
Boston wasn&rsquo;t studying the matter extra
careful, and as the Hen found he took pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
much what she give him she just cracked
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To run, I tell you,&rdquo; says the Hen, &ldquo;is
but to court the quicker coming of the torturing
death to which we are doomed. It
will come quick enough, anyway!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and she
handed out a fresh lot of shivers, and throwed
in sobs. Then she give a jump, as if the
notion&rsquo;d just struck her, and says: &ldquo;There
is a chance for us! Up on the roof of this
house we may be safe. Lions can spring
enormous distances horizontally, you know;
but, save in exceptional cases, their vertical
jumping powers are restricted to a marked
degree. Quick! Put your foot in my hand
and let me start you. When you are up, you
can pull me up after you. Now then!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
the Hen reached her hand down so she could
get a-hold of Boston&rsquo;s foot and give him a
send.</p>
<p>Her using them long words about the way
lions did their jumping&ndash;&ndash;being the kind of
talk he was used to&ndash;&ndash;seemed to sort of brace
him. Anyways&ndash;&ndash;the lion helping hurry things
by just then giving another jump or two&ndash;&ndash;he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
managed to have sense enough to put his
foot in the Hen&rsquo;s hand, same as she told him;
and then she let out her muscle and give him
such an up-start he was landed on the roof
of the &rsquo;dobe afore he fairly knowed he&rsquo;d
begun to go! Being landed, he just sprawled
out flat&ndash;&ndash;and getting the Hen up after him
seemed to be about the last thing he had on
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; sung out the Hen. &ldquo;The
lion is almost on me! Give me your hand!&rdquo;
But Boston wasn&rsquo;t in no shape to give hands
to nobody. All he did was to kick his legs
about and let off groans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand, now,&rdquo; says the Hen in
a minute. &ldquo;You are crying out in the hope
of luring the creature into trying to reach
you&ndash;&ndash;as he can, if he happens to be one of
the exceptional jumpers&ndash;&ndash;and so give me a
chance to get away. How noble that is of
you! I shall take the chance, my brave
preserver, that your self-sacrifice gives me&ndash;&ndash;and
I shall collect, and bedew with tears of
gratitude, all that the savage monster leaves
me of your bones! Heaven bless you&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
good-bye!&rdquo; And away the Hen cut&ndash;&ndash;leaving
Boston high and dry on the roof of the &rsquo;dobe,
so scared he just lay there like a wet rag.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t cut far, the Hen didn&rsquo;t. The
rest of us was a-setting around under the
mesquite bushes, and she joined the party
and set down too&ndash;&ndash;stuffing her handkerchief
into her mouth, and holding both hands
jammed tight over it, to keep from yelling
out with the laugh that was pretty near
cracking her sides.</p>
<p>Then we all waited till daylight&ndash;&ndash;with
Shorty, who had charge of the lion, working
that animal as seemed to be needed whenever
Boston quieted down with his groans. All
hands really enjoyed theirselves, and it was
one of the shortest nights I think I ever
knowed.</p>
<p>Daylight comes sudden in them parts.
One minute it&rsquo;s so darkish you can&rsquo;t see nothing&ndash;&ndash;and
the next minute the sun comes up
with a bounce from behind the mountains
and things is all clear.</p>
<p>When the sun did his part of the work and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
give all the light was needed, we done ours&ndash;&ndash;which
was coming out from among the mesquite
bushes and saying good-morning polite
to Boston, up on the roof of the &rsquo;dobe, and
then taking the hobbles off old man Gutierrez&rsquo;s
jackass so it could walk away home.</p>
<p>The Hen felt she needed to have one more
shot, and she took it. &ldquo;My brave preserver!&rdquo;
says the Hen, speaking cheerful.
&ldquo;Come down to me&ndash;&ndash;that I may bedew with
tears of gratitude your bones!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>SHORTY SMITH&rsquo;S HANGING</h3>
</div>
<p>Some of them summer days in
Palomitas was that hot they&rsquo;d
melt the stuffing out of a lightning-rod,
and you could cook
eggs in the pockets of your
pants. When things was that way the town
was apt to get quieted down&ndash;&ndash;most being
satisfied to take enough drinks early to make
it pleasant spending the rest of the day sleeping
&rsquo;em off somewheres in the shade. Along
late in the afternoon, though, the wind always
breezed down real cool and pleasant
from the mountains&ndash;&ndash;and then the boys
would wake up and get a brace on, and whatever
was going to happen would begin.</p>
<p>Being that sort of weather, nobody was
paying no attention worth speaking of to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
nothing: and when the Denver train come
in&ndash;&ndash;being about three hours late, like it had
a way of being, after a wash-out&ndash;&ndash;the place
was in such a blister that pretty much all
you could hear to show anybody was alive
in Palomitas was snores. Besides Wood&ndash;&ndash;who
had to be awake to do his work when
the train got there&ndash;&ndash;and the clump of Mexicans
that always hung around the deepo at
train-time, there wasn&rsquo;t half a dozen folks
with their eyes open in the whole town.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; Charley was one of the few that
was awake and sober. He made a point,
Santa F&eacute; did, of being on hand when the
train come in because there always was
chances somebody might be aboard he could
do business with; and he had to keep sober,
mostly, same as I&rsquo;ve said, or he couldn&rsquo;t
a-done his work so it would pay. He used
to square things up&ndash;&ndash;when he really couldn&rsquo;t
stand the strain no longer&ndash;&ndash;by knocking off
dealing and having a good one lasting about
a week at a time. It was while he was on
one of them tears of his, going it worse&rsquo;n
usual, he got cleaned out in Denver Jones&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
place&ndash;&ndash;and him able, when he hadn&rsquo;t a jag
on, to wipe up the floor with Denver!&ndash;&ndash;and
then went ahead the next day, being still
jagged, and shot poor old Bill Hart. But
them is matters that happened a little later,
and will be spoke of further on.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the train pulled in alongside the
deepo platform it didn&rsquo;t seem at first there
was nobody on it but the usual raft of Mexicans
with bundles in the day-coach&ndash;&ndash;who all
come a-trooping out, cluttered up with their
queer duds, and went to hugging their aunts
and uncles who was waiting for &rsquo;em in real
Mexican style. Charley looked the lot over
and seen there was nothing in it worth taking
time to; and then he got his Denver paper
from the messenger in the express-car and
started off to go on back to his room in the
Forest Queen.</p>
<p>Down he come along the platform&ndash;&ndash;he was
a-looking at his <i>Tribune</i>, and not paying no
attention&ndash;&ndash;and just as he got alongside the
Pullman a man stepped off it and most
plumped into him; and would a-plumped if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
he hadn&rsquo;t been so beat out by the hot weather
he was going slow. He was a little round
friendly looking feller, with a red face and
little gray side-whiskers; and he was dressed
up in black same as Charley was&ndash;&ndash;only he&rsquo;d
a shorter-tailed coat, and hadn&rsquo;t a white tie
on, and was wearing a shiny plug hat that
looked most extra unsuitable in them parts
on that sort of a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir!&rdquo; says the little
man, as he pulled himself up just in time to
keep from bumping.</p>
<p>Charley bowed handsome&ndash;&ndash;there was no
ketching off Santa F&eacute; when it come to slinging
good manners, his being that gentlemanly he
could a-give points to a New York bar-keep&ndash;&ndash;and
says back: &ldquo;Sir, I beg yours! Heedlessness
is my besetting sin. The fault is mine!&rdquo;
And then he said, keeping on talking the
toney way he knowed how to: &ldquo;I trust, sir,
that you are not incommoded by the heat.
Even for New Mexico in August, this is a
phenomenally hot day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figtag'>

&ldquo;&lsquo;IT&rsquo;S HOTTER THAN SAHARA!&rsquo; SAID THE ENGLISHMAN&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Incommoded is no name for it!&rdquo; says the
little man, taking off his shiny hat and mopping
away at himself with his pocket-handkerchief.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never encountered such heat
anywhere. It&rsquo;s hotter than Sahara! In
England we have nothing like it at all.&rdquo;
Then he mopped himself some more, and
went ahead again&ndash;&ndash;seeming glad to have
somebody to let out to: &ldquo;My whole life long
I&rsquo;ve been finding fault with our August
weather in London. I&rsquo;ll never find fault
with it again. I&rsquo;d give fifty pounds to be
back there now, even in my office in the
City&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;d give a hundred willingly if I
could walk out of this frying-pan into my
own home in the Avenue Road! If you
know London, sir, you know that St. John&rsquo;s
Wood is the coolest part of it, and that
the coolest part of St. John&rsquo;s Wood&ndash;&ndash;up by
the side of Primrose Hill&ndash;&ndash;is the Avenue
Road; and so you can understand why thinking
about coming out from the Underground
and walking homeward in the cool of the
evening almost gives me a pain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; allowed he wasn&rsquo;t acquainted
with that locality; but he said he hadn&rsquo;t no
doubt&ndash;&ndash;since you couldn&rsquo;t get a worse one&ndash;&ndash;it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
was a better place in summer than Palomitas.
And then he kind of chucked it in
casual that as the little man didn&rsquo;t seem to
take much stock in Palomitas maybe he&rsquo;d
a-done as well if he&rsquo;d stuck at home.</p>
<p>Charley&rsquo;s talking that way brought out he
wasn&rsquo;t there because he wanted to be, but
because he was sent: coming to look things
over for the English stockholders&ndash;&ndash;who was
about sick, he said, of dropping assessments
in the slot and nothing coming out when
they pushed the button&ndash;&ndash;before they chipped
in the fresh stake they was asked for to help
along with the building of the road. He said
he about allowed, though, the call was a
square one, what he&rsquo;d seen being in the road&rsquo;s
favor and as much as was claimed for it; but
when it come to the country and the people,
he said, there was no denying they both was
as beastly as they could be. Then he turned
round sudden on Santa F&eacute; and says: &ldquo;I infer
from your dress, sir, that you are in Orders;
and I therefore assume that you represent
what little respectability this town has. Will
you kindly tell me if it is possible in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
filthy place to procure a brandy-and-soda,
and a bath, and any sort of decent food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It always sort of tickled Santa F&eacute;, same as
I&rsquo;ve said, when a tenderfoot took him for a
fire-escape; and when it happened that way
he give it back to &rsquo;em in right-enough parson
talk. So he says to the little man, speaking
benevolent: &ldquo;In our poor way, sir, we can
satisfy your requirements. At the Forest
Queen Hotel, over there, you can procure the
liquid refreshment that you name; and also
food as good as our little community affords.
As for your bath, we can provide it on a
scale of truly American magnificence. We
can offer you a tub, sir, very nearly two
thousand miles long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tub two thousand miles long?&rdquo; says
the little man. &ldquo;Oh, come now, you&rsquo;re
chaffing me. There can&rsquo;t be a tub like that,
you know. There really can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer, sir,&rdquo; says Santa F&eacute;, &ldquo;to the Rio
Grande.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man took his time getting there,
but when he did ketch up he laughed hearty.
&ldquo;How American that is!&rdquo; says he. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
then he says over again: &ldquo;How American
that is!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he laughed some more. Then
he said he&rsquo;d start &rsquo;em to getting his grub
ready while he was bathing in that two-thousand-mile
bath-tub, and he&rsquo;d have his
brandy-and-soda right away; and he asked
Charley&ndash;&ndash;speaking doubtful, and looking at
his white necktie&ndash;&ndash;if he&rsquo;d have one too?</p>
<p>Charley said he just would; and it was
seeing how sort of surprised the little man
looked, he told the boys afterwards, set him
to thinking he might as well kill time that hot
day trying how much stuffing that sort of a
tenderfoot would hold. He said at first he
only meant to play a short lone hand for the
fun of the thing; and it was the way the little
man swallowed whatever was give him, he
said, that made the game keep on a-growing&ndash;&ndash;till
it ended up by roping in the whole
town. So off he went, explaining fatherly
how it come that preachers and brandys-and-sodas
in Palomitas got along together first
class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this wildly lawless and sinful community,
sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I find that my humble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
efforts at moral improvement are best advanced
by identifying my life as closely as
may be with the lives of those whom I would
lead to higher planes. At first, in my ignorance,
I held aloof from participating in
the customs&ndash;&ndash;many of them, seemingly,
objectionable&ndash;&ndash;of my parishioners. Naturally,
in turn, they held aloof from me. I
made no impression upon them. The good
seed that I scattered freely fell upon barren
ground. Now, as the result of experience,
and of much soulful thought, I am wiser.
Over a friendly glass at the bar of the Forest
Queen, or at other of the various bars in our
little town, I can talk to a parishioner with a
kindly familiarity that brings him close to me.
By taking part in the games of chance which
form the main amusement of my flock, I still
more closely can identify their interests with
my own&ndash;&ndash;and even materially improve, by
such winnings as come to me in our friendly
encounters, our meagre parish finances. I
have as yet taken no share in the gun-fights
which too frequently occur in our somewhat
tempestuous little community; but I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
seriously considering the advisability of still
farther strengthening my hold upon the respect
and the affection of my parishioners by
now and then exchanging shots with them. I
am confident that such energetic action on
my part will tend still more to endear me to
them&ndash;&ndash;and, after all, I must not be too nicely
fastidious as to means if I would compass
my end of winning their trust and their
esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Santa F&eacute; was talking along so slick
about the way he managed his parsoning, the
little man&rsquo;s eyes was getting bulgier and
bulgier; and when it come to his taking a
hand in shooting-scrapes they looked like
they was going to jump out of his head. All
he could say was: &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; Then he
kind of gagged, and said he&rsquo;d be obliged if he
could get his brandy-and-soda right off.</p>
<p>Charley steered him across to the Forest
Queen, and when he had his drink in him,
and another on top of it, he seemed to get
some of his grip back. But even after his
drinks he seemed like he thought he must be
asleep and dreaming; and he said twice over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
he&rsquo;d never heard tell of such doings in all his
born days.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; just give a wink across the bar to
Blister Mike&ndash;&ndash;who didn&rsquo;t need much winking,
being a wide-awake one&ndash;&ndash;and then he
went ahead with some more of the same kind.
&ldquo;No doubt, my dear sir, in the older civilization
to which you are accustomed my methods
would seem irregular&ndash;&ndash;perhaps even
reprehensible. In England, very likely, unfavorable
comment would be made upon a
pastor who cordially drank with members of
his flock at public bars; who also&ndash;&ndash;I do not
hesitate, you see, to give our little games of
chance their harshest name&ndash;&ndash;in a friendly
way gambled with them; and I can imagine
that the spectacle of a parish priest engaging
with his parishioners, up and down the street
of a quiet village, in a fight with six-shooters
and Winchesters would be very generally
disapproved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible, quite impossible,&rdquo; says
the little man, sort of gaspy, &ldquo;to imagine
such a horrible monstrosity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely for you, sir,&rdquo; says Charley,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
speaking affable, &ldquo;it is. But you must remember
that ours is a young and a vigorous
community&ndash;&ndash;too young, too vigorous, to be
cramped and trammelled by obsolete conventions
and narrow Old-World rules. Life
with us, you see, has an uncertain suddenness&ndash;&ndash;owing
to our energetic habit of settling our
little differences promptly, and in a decisive
way. At the last meeting of our Sunshine
Club, for instance&ndash;&ndash;as the result of a short
but heated argument&ndash;&ndash;Brother Michael, here,
felt called upon to shoot a fellow-member.
While recognizing that the occurrence was
unavoidable, we regretted it keenly&ndash;&ndash;Brother
Michael most of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I did that,&rdquo; said Blister, playing out
quick to the lead Charley give him. &ldquo;But
your Reverence remembers he drew on me
first&ndash;&ndash;and if he&rsquo;d been sober enough to shoot
straight it&rsquo;s meself, and not him, would be
by now living out in the cemetery on the
mesa; and another&rsquo;d be serving your drinks
to you across this bar. I had the rights on
my side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; says Charley. &ldquo;You see, sir,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
it was a perfectly fair fight. Brother Michael
and his fellow-member exchanged their shots
in an honorable manner&ndash;&ndash;and, while we
mourn the sudden decease of our friend lost
to us, our friend who survives has suffered
no diminution of our affectionate regard.
Had the shooting been unfair, then the case
would have gone into another category&ndash;&ndash;and
our community promptly would have manifested
the sturdy sense of justice that is inherent
in it by hanging the man by whom
the unfair shot had been fired. Believe me,
sir&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and Santa F&eacute; stood up straight and
stuck his chest out&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Palomitas has its own
high standards of morality: and it never
fails to maintain those standards in its own
stern way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man didn&rsquo;t say nothing back.
He looked like he was sort of mazed. All he
did was to ask for another brandy-and-soda;
and when he&rsquo;d took it he allowed he&rsquo;d skip
having his bath and get at his eating right
away&ndash;&ndash;saying he was feeling faintish, and
maybe what he needed was food. Of course
that was no time of day to get victuals: but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Santa F&eacute; was a good one at managing, and
he fixed it up so he had some sort of a hash
layout; and before he went at it he give him
a wash-up in his own room.</p>
<p>It was while he was hashing, Charley said,
the notion come to him how Palomitas might
have some real sport with him&ndash;&ndash;the same kind
they had when Hart&rsquo;s aunt come on her visit,
only twisting things round so it would be the
holy terror side of the town that had the
show. And he said as he&rsquo;d started in with
the preacher racket, he thought they might
keep that up too&ndash;&ndash;and make such an out and
out mix-up for the little man as would give
cards to any tenderfoot game that ever was
played. Santa F&eacute; always was full of his
pranks: and this one looked to pan out so
well, and was so easy done, that he went right
across to the deepo and had a talk with Wood
about how things had better be managed;
and Wood, who liked fun as much as anybody,
caught on quick and agreed to take a
hand.</p>
<p>The little man seemed to get a brace when
he had his grub inside of him; and over he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
went to the deepo and give Wood the order
he had from the President to see the books&ndash;&ndash;and
was real intelligent, Wood said, in finding
out how railroading in them parts was done.
But when he&rsquo;d cleaned up his railroad job,
and took to asking questions about the
Territory, and Palomitas, and things generally&ndash;&ndash;and
got the sort of answers Santa
F&eacute; had fixed should be give him, with some
more throwed in&ndash;&ndash;Wood said his feet showed
to be that tender he allowed it would a-hurt
him with thick boots on to walk on boiled
beans.</p>
<p>Wood said he guessed he broke the lying
record that afternoon; and he said he reckoned
if the little man swallowed half of what was
give him, and there wasn&rsquo;t much of anything
he gagged at, he must a-thought Palomitas&ndash;&ndash;with
its church twice Sundays and prayer-meetings
regular three times a week, and its
faro-bank with the preacher for dealer, and
its Sunshine Club that was all mixed in with
shooting-scrapes, and its Friendly Aid Society
that attended mostly to what lynchings was
needed&ndash;&ndash;was something like a bit of heaven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
that had broke out from the corral it belonged
in and gone to grazing in hell&rsquo;s front yard!</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;d stuffed him as much as was
needed, Wood told him&ndash;&ndash;Santa F&eacute; having
fixed it that way&ndash;&ndash;there was a Mexican
church about a thousand years old over in the
Ca&ntilde;ada that was worth looking at; and he
told him he&rsquo;d take him across on his buck-board
to see it if he cared to go. He bit at
that, just as Santa F&eacute; counted on; and about
four o&rsquo;clock off they went&ndash;&ndash;it was only three
mile or so down to the Ca&ntilde;ada&ndash;&ndash;in good time
to get him back and give him what more was
coming to him before he started off North
again on the night train. Wood said the ride
was real enjoyable&ndash;&ndash;the little man showing
up as sensible as anybody when he got to the
church and struck things he knowed about;
and it turned out he could talk French, and
that pleased the padre&ndash;&ndash;he was that French
one I&rsquo;ve spoke about, who was as white as
they make &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;and so things went along well.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The wind had set in to blow down the
valley cool and pleasant as they was getting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
along home; and coming down on it, when
they got about half a mile from Palomitas,
they begun to hear shooting&ndash;&ndash;and it kept on,
and more of it, the closer they come to town.
Knowing what Santa F&eacute; had set the boys up
to, Wood said he pretty near laughed out
when he heard it; but he held in, he said&ndash;&ndash;and
told the little man, when he asked what
it meant, that it didn&rsquo;t mean nothing in particular:
being only some sort of a shooting-scrape,
like enough&ndash;&ndash;the same as often happened
along about that time in the afternoon.</p>
<p>He said the little man looked queerish,
and wanted to know if the men in the town
was shooting at a target; and when Wood said
he guessed they was targetting at each other,
and likely there&rsquo;d be some occurrences, he
said he looked queerisher&ndash;&ndash;and said such
savagery was too horrible to be true. But
he wasn&rsquo;t worried a bit about himself, Wood
said&ndash;&ndash;he was as nervy a little man, Wood
said, as he&rsquo;d ever got up to&ndash;&ndash;and all he wanted
was to have Wood whip the mules up,
so he&rsquo;d get there quick and see what was
going on. Wood whipped up, right enough,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and the mules took &rsquo;em a-kiting&ndash;&ndash;going at a
full run the last half-mile or so, and not coming
down to a walk till they&rsquo;d crossed the
bridge over the Rio Grande and was most to
the top of the hill. At the top of the hill
they stopped&ndash;&ndash;and that was a good place to
stop at, for the circus was a-going on right
there.</p>
<p>Things really did look serious; and Wood
said&ndash;&ndash;for all he&rsquo;d been told what was coming&ndash;&ndash;he
more&rsquo;n half thought the boys had got to
rumpussing in dead earnest. Three or four
was setting on the ground with their sleeves
and pants rolled up tying up their arms and
legs with their pocket-handkerchiefs; there
was a feller&ndash;&ndash;Nosey Green, it turned out to be&ndash;&ndash;laying
on one side in a sort of mixed-up
heap like as if he&rsquo;d dropped sudden; right in
the middle of the road Blister Mike was
sprawled out, with Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;his black
clothes all over dust and his hat off&ndash;&ndash;holding
his head with one hand and feeling at his
heart with the other; and just as the buck-board
stopped, right in the thick of it,
Kerosene Kate come a-tearing along, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Sage-Brush Hen close after her, and plumped
down on Mike and yelled out: &ldquo;Oh, my husband!
My poor husband! He is foully
slain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all so natural, Wood said, that seeing
it sudden that way give him a first-class
jolt. For a minute, he said, he couldn&rsquo;t
help thinking it was the real thing. As for
the little man&ndash;&ndash;and he likely would have
took matters just the same, and no blame to
him, if his feet had been as hard as anybody&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;he
swallowed the show whole. &ldquo;Good
Heavens!&rdquo; says he, getting real palish.
&ldquo;What a dreadful thing this is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Santa let go of Mike&rsquo;s head and got up,
brushing his pants off, and says solemn:
&ldquo;Our poor brother has passed from us.
Palomitas has lost one of its most useful
citizens&ndash;&ndash;there was nobody who could mix
drinks as he could&ndash;&ndash;and the world has lost a
noble man! Take away his stricken wife,
my dear,&rdquo; he says, speaking to the Sage-Brush
Hen. &ldquo;Take poor Sister Rebecca
home with you to the parsonage&ndash;&ndash;my duties
lie elsewhere at present&ndash;&ndash;and pour out to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
from your tender heart the balm of comfort
that you so well know how to give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he come along to the buck-board,
and says to the little man: &ldquo;I greatly regret
that this unfortunate incident should have
occurred while you are with us. From
every point of view the event is lamentable.
Brother Green, known familiarly among us
because of his facial peculiarity as Nosey
Green&ndash;&ndash;the gentleman piled up over there on
the other side of the road&ndash;&ndash;was as noble-hearted
a man as ever lived; so was Brother
Michael, whom you met in all the pride of his
manly strength only this morning at the
Forest Queen bar. Both were corner-stones
of our Sunshine Club, and among the most
faithful of my parishioners. In deep despondency
we mourn their loss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is dreadful&ndash;&ndash;dreadful!&rdquo; says the little
man. And then he wanted to know how the
shooting begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dispute that has come to this doubly
fatal ending,&rdquo; says Santa F&eacute;, shaking his
head sorrowful, &ldquo;related to cock-tails. In
what I am persuaded was a purely jesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
spirit, Brother Green cast aspersions upon
Brother Michael&rsquo;s skill as a drink-mixer. The
injustice of his remarks, even in jest, aroused
Brother Michael&rsquo;s hot Celtic nature and led
to a retort, harshly personal, that excited
Brother Green&rsquo;s anger&ndash;&ndash;and from words they
passed quickly to a settlement of the matter
with their guns. However, as the fight was
conducted by both of them in an honorable
manner, and was creditable equally to their
courage and to their proficiency in the use
of arms, it is now a back number and we may
discharge it from our minds. Moreover, my
dear sir, our little domestic difficulties must
not be suffered to interfere with the duties
of hospitality. It is high time that you
should have your supper; and I even venture
to ask that you will hurry your meal a little&ndash;&ndash;to
the end that you may have opportunity,
before the departure of your train this evening,
to see something of the brighter side of
our little town. After this sombre scene,
you will find, I trust, agreeable mental refreshment
in witnessing&ndash;&ndash;perhaps even in
participating in&ndash;&ndash;our friendly card-playing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
and in taking part with us in our usual cheerful
evening dance. By your leave, Brother
Wood, I will seat myself on the rear of your
buck-board and drive along with you into
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man was too jolted to say anything&ndash;&ndash;and
up Charley hiked on the back of
the buck-board, and away they went down
the road. The rest followed on after: with
the Hen holding fast to Kerosene, and Kerosene
yelling for all she was worth; and behind
come some of the boys toting Blister&rsquo;s corpse&ndash;&ndash;with
Blister swearing at &rsquo;em for the way
they had his legs twisted, and ending by kicking
loose and making a break by the shortcut
back of the freight-house for home. The
other corpse&ndash;&ndash;seeing the way Blister was
monkeyed with&ndash;&ndash;stood off the ones that
wanted to carry him, allowing he&rsquo;d be more
comfortable if he walked.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the buck-board got down to the
deepo the little man said he felt sickish&ndash;&ndash;not
being used to such goings-on&ndash;&ndash;and didn&rsquo;t
care much for eating his supper; and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
said he thought likely he&rsquo;d be better if he
had a brandy-and-soda to settle his insides.
So him and Santa F&eacute; went across to the
Forest Queen to get it&ndash;&ndash;and the first thing
they struck was Blister, come to life again,
behind the bar!</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; hadn&rsquo;t counted on that card
coming out&ndash;&ndash;but he shook one to meet it
down his sleeve, and played it as quick as
he knowed how. &ldquo;Ah, Patrick,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;so you have taken your poor brother&rsquo;s
place.&rdquo; And to the little man, who was
staring at Blister like a stuck pig, he says:
&ldquo;They were twin brothers, sir, this gentleman
and the deceased&ndash;&ndash;and, as you see, so
alike that few of their closest friends could
tell them apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was worse than that,&rdquo; says Blister,
following right along with the same suit.
&ldquo;Only when one of us was drunk and the
other sober, and that way there being a difference
betwane us, could we tell our own
selves apart&ndash;&ndash;and indade I&rsquo;m half for thinking
that maybe it&rsquo;s meself, and not poor
Mike, that&rsquo;s been killed by Nosey Green this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
day. But whichever of us it is that&rsquo;s dead,
it&rsquo;s a domn good job&ndash;&ndash;if your Reverence will
excuse me saying so&ndash;&ndash;the other one of us
has made of Nosey: bad luck to the heart
and lights of him, that are cooking this
blessed minute in the hottest corner of
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! Brother Patrick,&rdquo; says Santa
F&eacute;, speaking friendly but serious. &ldquo;You
know how strongly I feel about profanity&ndash;&ndash;even
when, as in the present instance, justly
aroused resentment lends to it a colorable
excuse. And also, my dear brother, I beg
you to temper with charity your views as to
Brother Green&rsquo;s present whereabouts. It is
sufficient for all purposes of human justice
that he has passed away. And now, if you
please, you will supply our visitor, here&ndash;&ndash;whose
nerves not unnaturally are shaken by
the tragic events of the past hour&ndash;&ndash;with the
brandy-and-soda that I am satisfied he really
needs. In that need, my own nerves being
badly disordered, I myself share; and as the
agonizing loss that you have suffered has put
a still more severe strain upon your nerves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Brother Patrick, I beg that you will join us.
The drinks are on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure your Reverence has a kind heart in
you, and that&rsquo;s the holy truth,&rdquo; says Blister.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to me poor dead brother&rsquo;s health I&rsquo;ll
be drinking, and with all the good-will in the
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had another after that; and then
Blister said there was luck in odd numbers,
and he wanted to show Palomitas knowed
how to be hospitable to strangers, and they
must have one on the bar. They had it all
right, and by that time&ndash;&ndash;having the three of
&rsquo;em in him&ndash;&ndash;the little man said he was feeling
better; but, even with his drinks to help
him, when he come to eating his supper he
didn&rsquo;t make out much of a meal. He seemed
to be all sort of dreamy, and was like he
didn&rsquo;t know where he was.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; kept a-talking away to him cheerful
while they was hashing; and when they&rsquo;d
finished off he told him he hoped what he&rsquo;d
see of the bright side of Palomitas&ndash;&ndash;before
his train started&ndash;&ndash;would make him forget the
cruelly sorrowful shadows of that melancholy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
afternoon. He was a daisy at word-slinging,
Charley was&ndash;&ndash;better&rsquo;n most auctioneers.
Then they come along together back to the
bar-room&ndash;&ndash;where the cloth was off the table,
and the cards and chips out, ready for business
to begin. All the boys was jammed in
there&ndash;&ndash;Nosey Green with his face tied up like
he had a toothache, so it didn&rsquo;t show who he
was&ndash;&ndash;waiting to see what more was coming;
and they was about busting with the laughs
they had inside &rsquo;em, and ready to play close
up to Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Charley set down to deal, same as usual,
and asked the little man to set down aside of
him&ndash;&ndash;telling him he&rsquo;d likely be interested in
knowing that what come to the bank that
night would go to getting the melodeon the
Sunday-school needed bad. And then he
shoved the cards round the table, and things
begun. The little man took it all dreamy&ndash;&ndash;saying
kind of to himself he&rsquo;d never in all
his born days expected to see a minister making
money for Sunday-school melodeons by
running a faro-bank. But he wasn&rsquo;t so
dreamy but he had sense enough to keep out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
of the game. Santa F&eacute; kept a-asking him
polite to come in; but he kept answering
back polite he wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;saying he was no
sort of a hand at cards.</p>
<p>About the size of it was, in all the matters
he could see his way to that little man had
as good a load of sand as anybody&ndash;&ndash;and
more&rsquo;n most. Like enough at home he&rsquo;d
read a lot of them fool Wild West stories&ndash;&ndash;the
kind young fellers from the East, who
swallow all that&rsquo;s told &rsquo;em, write up in books
with scare pictures&ndash;&ndash;and that was why in
some ways he was so easy fooled. But I
guess it would a-been a mistake to pick him
up for a fool all round. Anyhow, Santa F&eacute;
got a set-back from him on his melodeon-faro
racket&ndash;&ndash;and set-backs didn&rsquo;t often come
Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a real game the little man was
up against, and like enough he had the savey
to ketch on to what was being give him.
For the look of the thing they&rsquo;d fixed to start
with a baby limit, and not raise it till he got
warmed up and asked to; and it was fixed
only what he dropped&ndash;&ndash;the rest going back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
to the boys&ndash;&ndash;should stay with the bank.
But as he didn&rsquo;t warm up any worth speaking
of, and wasn&rsquo;t giving himself no chances
at all to do any dropping, Santa F&eacute; pretty
soon found out they might as well hang up
the melodeon fund and go on to the next
turn.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Sage-Brush Hen managed most of
what come next, and she done it well. She&rsquo;d
dressed herself up in them white clothes of
hers with a little blue bow tied on at the
neck&ndash;&ndash;looking that quiet and tidy and real
lady-like you&rsquo;d never a-notioned what a
mixed lot she was truly&ndash;&ndash;and she&rsquo;d helped
the other girls rig out as near the same way
as they could come. Some of &rsquo;em didn&rsquo;t
come far; but they all done as well as they
knowed how to, and so they wasn&rsquo;t to be
blamed. Old Tenderfoot Sal&ndash;&ndash;she was the
limit, Sal was&ndash;&ndash;wasn&rsquo;t to be managed no
way; so they just kept her out of the show.</p>
<p>When Santa F&eacute; come to see faro-banking
for melodeons wasn&rsquo;t money-making, he
passed out word to the Hen to start up her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
part of the circus&ndash;&ndash;and in the Hen come,
looking real pretty in her white frock, and
put her hand on his shoulder married-like
and says: &ldquo;Now, my dear, it isn&rsquo;t fair for
you gentlemen to keep us ladies waiting
another minute longer. We want our share
in the evening&rsquo;s amusement. Do put the
cards away and let us have our dance.&rdquo; And
then she says to the little man, nice and
friendly: &ldquo;My husband is so eager to get
our melodeon&ndash;&ndash;and we really do need it
badly, of course&ndash;&ndash;that I have trouble with
him every night to make him stop the game
and give us ladies the dance that we do so
enjoy.&rdquo; And then she says on to Charley
again: &ldquo;How has the melodeon fund come
out to-night, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well indeed. Very well indeed, my
angel,&rdquo; Charley says back to her. &ldquo;Eleven
dollars and a half have been added to that
sacred deposit; and the contributions have
been so equally distributed that no one of us
will feel the trifling loss. But in interrupting
our game, my dear, you are quite right&ndash;&ndash;as
you always are. Our guest is not taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
part in it; and&ndash;&ndash;as he cannot be expected
to feel, as we do, a pleasurable excitement
in the augmentation of our cherished little
hoard&ndash;&ndash;we owe it to him to pass to a form
of harmless diversion in which he can have a
share.&rdquo; And then he says to the little man:
&ldquo;I am sure, sir, that Mrs. Charles will be
charmed to have you for her partner in the
opening dance of what we playfully term
our ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pleasure will be mine,&rdquo; says the
little man&ndash;&ndash;he was a real friendly polite little
old feller&ndash;&ndash;and up he gets and bows to the
Hen handsome and gives her his arm: and
then in he went with her to the dance-hall,
with Santa F&eacute; and the rest of us following
on. It give us a first-class jolt to find all
the girls so quiet-looking; and they being
that way braced up the whole crowd to be
like a dancing-party back East. To see the
boys a-bowing away to their partners, while
Jos&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;he was the fiddler, Jos&eacute; was&ndash;&ndash;was a
tuning up, you wouldn&rsquo;t a-knowed where
you was!</p>
<p>It was a square dance to start in with:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
with the little man and the Hen, and Charley
and Kerosene Kate, a-facing each other; and
Denver Jones with Carrots&ndash;&ndash;that was the
only name she ever had in Palomitas&ndash;&ndash;and
Shorty Smith and Juanita, at the sides.
Them three was the girls the Hen had done
best with; and she&rsquo;d fixed &rsquo;em off so well
they most might have passed for back-East
school-ma&rsquo;ams&ndash;&ndash;at least, in a thickish crowd.
Everybody else just stood around and looked
on&ndash;&ndash;and that time, with all the Forest Queen
ways of managing dancing upset, it was the
turn of the Palomitas folks to think they&rsquo;d
struck a dream! The little man, of course,
didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d struck anything but what
went on always&ndash;&ndash;and the way he kicked
around spirited on them short little fat legs
of his was just a sight to see!</p>
<p>Like as not he hadn&rsquo;t got a good sight of
Kerosene Kate while she was doing her killed
husband act before supper; or, maybe, it
was her being dressed up so tidy made a
difference. Anyways, he didn&rsquo;t at first
ketch on to her being about the freshest-made
widow he&rsquo;d ever tumbled to in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
dancing-party. But he got there all right
when the square dance was over, and Jos&eacute;
flourished his fiddle and sung out for the
Se&ntilde;ores and Se&ntilde;oritas to take partners for a
<i>valsa</i>, and the Hen brought up Kerosene to
foot it with him&ndash;&ndash;telling him she was the
organist who was going to play the melodeon
when they got it, and he&rsquo;d find her a nice
partner as she was about the best dancer
they had.</p>
<p>When he did size her up he was that took
aback he couldn&rsquo;t talk straight. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;but,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this the lady whose
husband was&ndash;&ndash;was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and he stuck fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose husband met with an accident
this afternoon,&rdquo; says the Hen, helping him
out with it. &ldquo;Yes, this is our poor sister
Rebecca&ndash;&ndash;but the accident happened, you
know, so many hours ago that the pang of
it has passed; and&ndash;&ndash;as Mr. Green, the gentleman
who shot her husband, was shot right
off himself&ndash;&ndash;she feels, as we all do, that the
incident is closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Kerosene put in: &ldquo;Great Scott,
mister, you don&rsquo;t know Palomitas! Widows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
in these parts don&rsquo;t set round moping their
heads off all the rest of their lives. They
wait long enough for politeness&ndash;&ndash;same as I&rsquo;ve
done&ndash;&ndash;and then they start in on a new
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man likely was too mixed up to
notice Kerosene didn&rsquo;t talk pretty, like Santa
F&eacute; and the Hen knowed how to; and he was
so all-round jolted that before he knew it&ndash;&ndash;Kerosene
getting a-hold of his hand with one
of hers, and putting the other on his shoulder&ndash;&ndash;he
had his arm round her waist kind of by
instinct and was footing it away with her the
best he knowed how. But while he was a-circling
about with her he was the dreamiest
looking one you ever seen. Kerosene said
afterwards she heard him saying to himself
over and over: &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be real! This
can&rsquo;t be real!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happened along right away after
was real enough for him&ndash;&ndash;at least, he thought
it was, and that come to the same thing. He
was so dizzied up when Kerosene stopped
dancing him&ndash;&ndash;she was doing the most of it,
she said, he keeping his little fat legs going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
&rsquo;cause she swung him round and he had to&ndash;&ndash;all
he wanted was to be let to set down. So
Kerosene set him&ndash;&ndash;and then the next act
was put through.</p>
<p>Bill Hart and Shorty Smith come up to
Kerosene right together, and both of &rsquo;em
asked her polite if she&rsquo;d dance. She said
polite she&rsquo;d be happy to; but she said, seeing
both gentlemen had spoke at once for her,
they must fix it between &rsquo;em which one had
the call. All the same, she put her hand on
Hart&rsquo;s arm, like as if he was the one she
wanted&ndash;&ndash;and of course that pleased Hart
and made Shorty mad. Then the two of &rsquo;em
begun talking to each other, Hart speaking
sarcastic and Shorty real ugly, and so things
went on getting hotter and hotter&ndash;&ndash;till Kerosene,
doing it like she meant to break up the
rumpus, shoved Hart&rsquo;s arm round her and
started to swing away. Just as they got
a-going, Shorty out with his gun and loosed
off at Hart with it&ndash;&ndash;and down Hart went
in a heap on the floor.</p>

&ldquo;AND DOWN HART WENT IN A HEAP ON THE FLOOR&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>The whole place, of course, right away
broke into yells and cusses, and everybody
come a-crowding into a heap&ndash;&ndash;some of the
boys picking up Hart and carrying him, kicking
feeble real natural, out into the kitchen;
and some more grabbing a-hold of Shorty and
taking away his gun. Kerosene let off howls
fit to blow the roof off&ndash;&ndash;only quieting down
long enough to say she&rsquo;d just agreed to take
Hart for her second, and it was hard luck to
be made a widow of twice in one day. Then
she howled more. Really, things did go
with a hum!</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; and the rest come a-trooping
back from the kitchen&ndash;&ndash;leaving the door
just a crack open, so Hart could peep through
and see the fun&ndash;&ndash;and Santa F&eacute; jumped up
on a bench and sung out &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; as loud
as he could yell. Knowing what was expected
of &rsquo;em, the boys quieted down sudden;
and the Hen got a-hold of Kerosene
and snuggled her up to her, and told her to
weep on her fond breast&ndash;&ndash;and Kerosene
started in weeping on the Hen&rsquo;s fond breast
all right, and left off her howls. The room
was that quiet you could a-heard a cat purr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brethren,&rdquo; says Charley, talking sad-sounding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
and digging away at his eyes with
his pocket-handkerchief, &ldquo;Brother Hart has
left us&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Hart being in the kitchen that was
dead true&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and for the third time to-day
our Sunshine Club has suffered a fatal loss.
Still more lamentable is the case of our
doubly stricken sister Rebecca&ndash;&ndash;only just
recovered, by time&rsquo;s healing touch, from the
despair of her tragic widowhood, and at the
threshold of a new glad life of wedded happiness&ndash;&ndash;who
again is desolately bereaved.&rdquo;
(Kerosene give a dreadful groan&ndash;&ndash;seeming to
feel something was expected of her&ndash;&ndash;and
then jammed back to the Hen&rsquo;s fond breast
again and kept on a-weeping like a pump.)
&ldquo;Our hearts are with Sister Rebecca in her
woe,&rdquo; says Charley. &ldquo;She has all our sympathy,
and the full help of our sustaining
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know anything about the sense of
this meeting,&rdquo; Hill chipped in, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to
do a damn sight more&rsquo;n sling around sympathy.&rdquo;
(Hill had a way of speaking careless,
but he didn&rsquo;t mean no harm by it.)
&ldquo;That shooting wasn&rsquo;t a square one,&rdquo; says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
Hill; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s likely there&rsquo;ll be another
member missing from the Sunshine Club for
doing it. There&rsquo;s telegraph-poles,&rdquo; says Hill,
&ldquo;right across the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Hill is right,&rdquo; Santa F&eacute; went on,
&ldquo;though I am pained that his unhappy disposition
to profanity remains uncurbed.
The shot that has laid low Brother Hart was
a foul one. Justice, my friends, exemplary
justice, must be meted out to the one who
laid and lowered him; and I reckon the
quicker we get Brother Smith over to the
deepo, and up on the usual telegraph-pole&ndash;&ndash;as
Brother Hill has suggested&ndash;&ndash;the better
it&rsquo;ll be for the moral record of our town.
All in favor of such action will please signify
it by saying &lsquo;Ay.&rsquo;&rdquo; And the whole crowd&ndash;&ndash;except
Shorty, who voted against it&ndash;&ndash;yelled
out &ldquo;Ay&rdquo; so loud it shook all the bottles in
the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ayes have it,&rdquo; says Santa F&eacute;, &ldquo;and
we will proceed. Brother Wood, as chairman
of the Friendly Aid Society, I beg that
you will go on ahead to the deepo and get
ready the rope that on these occasions you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
so obligingly lend us from the Company&rsquo;s
stores. Brother Jones and Brother Hill,
you will kindly bring along the prisoner.
The remaining Friendly Aiders present will
have the goodness, at the appropriate moment,
to render the assistance that they
usually supply.&rdquo; And off Charley went,
right after Wood, with the rest of us following
on: Hill and Denver yanking along
Shorty and flourishing their guns savage;
the girls in a pack around the Hen holding
on to Kerosene; and Kerosene doing her
share of what was wanted by letting out
yells.</p>
<p>The little man was left to himself a-purpose;
and he was so shook up, while he was
coming along with the crowd over to the
deepo, he couldn&rsquo;t say a word. But he
managed to get his stamps going, though
they didn&rsquo;t work well, when we was all on
the platform&ndash;&ndash;waiting while Wood rigged
up the rope on the telegraph-pole&ndash;&ndash;and he
asked Santa F&eacute;, speaking husky, what the
boys meant to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice!&rdquo; says Charley, talking as dignified
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
as a just-swore-in sheriff. &ldquo;As I explained
to you this morning, sir, nobody in
Palomitas ever stands in the way of a fair
fight&ndash;&ndash;like the one you happened to come
in on at the finish a few hours ago&ndash;&ndash;any more
than good citizens, elsewhere and under different
conditions, interfere with the processes
of the courts. But when the fight is not fair,
as in the present instance&ndash;&ndash;the gravamen of
the charge against Brother Smith being that
he loosed off into Brother Hart&rsquo;s back when
the latter did not know it was coming and
hadn&rsquo;t his gun out&ndash;&ndash;then the moral sense of
our community crystallizes promptly into
the punitive action that the case demands:
as you will see for yourself, inside of the next
ten minutes, when you see Brother Smith
run up on that second telegraph-pole to the
left and kicking his legs in the air until he
kicks himself into Kingdom Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; says the little man.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to&ndash;&ndash;to hang him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just rather are!&rdquo; says Santa F&eacute;.
And then he says, talking kind of cutting:
&ldquo;May I ask, sir, what you do in England with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
murderers? Do you pay &rsquo;em salaries, and
ask &rsquo;em out to tea-parties, and hire somebody
to see they have all the drinks they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man begun telling how English
folks manage such matters, and was real
excited. But nobody but the Hen paid no
attention to him. The Hen&ndash;&ndash;she and Kerosene
was standing close aside of him&ndash;&ndash;turned
round to him and said pleasant she always
enjoyed most the hangings they had by
moonlight (the moon was at the full, and
shining beautiful) because the moonlight,
she said, cast over them such a glamour of
romance. And her looking at moonlight
hangings that way seemed to give him such
a jolt he stopped talking and give a kind of
a gasp. There wasn&rsquo;t no more time for
talking, anyway&ndash;&ndash;for just then the train
backed in to the platform and the conductor
sung out the Friendly Aiders had got to get
a move on &rsquo;em, if them going by it was to
see the doings, and put Shorty through.</p>
<p>Being moonlight, and the shadows thick,
helped considerable&ndash;&ndash;keeping from showing
how the boys had fixed Shorty up so his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
hanging wouldn&rsquo;t come hard: with a lariat
run round under his arms, his shirt over it,
and a loop just inside his collar where they
could hitch the rope fast. When they did
hitch to it, things looked just as natural as
you please.</p>
<p>Shorty got right into the hanging spirit&ndash;&ndash;he
always was a comical little cuss, Shorty
was&ndash;&ndash;pleading pitiful with the boys to let
up on him; and, when they wouldn&rsquo;t, getting
a halt on &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;same as he&rsquo;d seen done
at real hangings&ndash;&ndash;by beginning to send messages
to all the folks he ever had. Santa F&eacute;
let him go on till he&rsquo;d got to his uncles and
cousins&ndash;&ndash;and then he said he guessed the
rest of the family could make out to do with
second-hand messages from them that had
them; and as it was past train-time, and the
distinguished stranger in their midst&ndash;&ndash;who
was going on it&ndash;&ndash;would enjoy seeing the show
through, the hanging had got to be shoved
right along. When Charley&rsquo;d give his order,
Carver come up&ndash;&ndash;he was the Pullman conductor,
Carver was, and he had his points
how to manage&ndash;&ndash;and steered the little man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
onto the back platform of the Pullman,
where he could see well; and so had things
all ready for the train to pull out as soon as
Shorty was swung off.</p>
<p>Wood, who&rsquo;d had experience, had the rope
rigged up in good shape over the cross-bar
of the telegraph-pole; and Hill and Denver
fetched old Shorty along&ndash;&ndash;with Shorty letting
on he was scared stiff, and yowling like he&rsquo;d
been ashamed to if it hadn&rsquo;t been a bunco
game he was playing&ndash;&ndash;and hitched him to
it, with the boys standing close round in a
clump so they hid the way it was done.</p>
<p>The little man was so worked up by that
time&ndash;&ndash;it likely being he hadn&rsquo;t seen much of
hangings&ndash;&ndash;he was just a-hopping: with his
plug hat off, and sousing the sweat off his
face with his pocket-handkerchief, and singing
out what was going on wasn&rsquo;t any better
than murder, and begging all hands not to
do what he said was such a dreadful deed.</p>
<p>But nobody paid no attention to him
(except Carver, he was a friendly feller, Carver
was, kept a lookout he didn&rsquo;t tumble
himself off the platform) and when Denver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
sung out things was ready, and Santa F&eacute;
sung out back for the Friendly Aiders to haul
away, the boys all grabbed onto the rope
together&ndash;&ndash;and up Shorty went a-kicking into
the air.</p>
<p>Shorty really did do his act wonderful:
kicking every which way at first, and then
only sort of squirming, and then quieting
down gradual till he just hung limp&ndash;&ndash;with
the kick all kicked out of him&ndash;&ndash;turning
round and round slow!</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;d quieted, the train conductor
swung his lantern to start her, and off she
went&ndash;&ndash;the little man standing there on the
back platform of the Pullman, a-grabbing
at the railing like he was dizzy, looking back
with all his eyes. And old Shorty up on the
telegraph-pole, making a black splotch twisting
about in the moonlight, was the last bit
of Palomitas he seen!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Next day but one Carver come down again
on his regular run, and he told the boys the
little man kept a-hanging onto the platform
railing and a-looking back hard till the train
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
got clean round the curve. Then he give a
kind of a coughing groan, Carver said, and
come inside the Pullman&ndash;&ndash;there wasn&rsquo;t no
other passengers that night in the Pullman&ndash;&ndash;and
plumped himself down on a seat anyways,
a-looking as white as a clean paper
collar; and for a while he just set there, like
he had a pain.</p>
<p>At last he roused up and reached for his
grip and got his flask out and had a good
one; and when he&rsquo;d had it he says to Carver,
as savage as if Carver&ndash;&ndash;who hadn&rsquo;t had no
hand in the doings&ndash;&ndash;was the whole business:
&ldquo;Sir, this America of yours is a continent of
chaos&ndash;&ndash;and you Americans are no better
than so many wild beasts!&rdquo; Then he had
another; and after that he went on, like he
was talking to himself: &ldquo;All I ask is to get
out of this nightmare of a country in a hurry&ndash;&ndash;and
safe back to my own home in the
Avenue Road!&rdquo; And from then on, Carver
said, till it was bedtime&ndash;&ndash;except now and
then he took another&ndash;&ndash;he just set still and
glared.</p>
<p>Carver said it wasn&rsquo;t any funeral of his,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
and so he didn&rsquo;t see no need to argue with
him. And he allowed, he said, maybe he
had some call to feel the way he did about
America, and to want to get quick out of it,
after being up against Palomitas for what
he guessed you might say was a full day.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>THE PURIFICATION OF PALOMITAS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the long run, same as I said
to start with, all tough towns
gets to where it&rsquo;s needed to
have a clean-up. Shooting-scrapes
is a habit that grows;
and after a while decent folks begins to be
sort of sick of such doings&ndash;&ndash;and of having
things all upside-downey generally&ndash;&ndash;and then
something a little extry happens, bringing
matters to a head, and the white men take
hold and the toughs is fired. Just to draw
a card anywheres from the pack&ndash;&ndash;there was
Durango. What made a clean town of
Durango was that woman getting killed in
bed in her tent&ndash;&ndash;the boys being rumpussing
around, same as usual, and a shot just happening
her way and taking her. It was felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
that outsiders&ndash;&ndash;and &rsquo;specially ladies&ndash;&ndash;oughtn&rsquo;t
to get no such treatment; and so they had a
spring house-cleaning&ndash;&ndash;after what I reckon
was the worst winter a town ever went
through&ndash;&ndash;and Durango was sobered right
down.</p>
<p>Palomitas went along the same trail, and
took the same pass over the divide. All
through that year, while the end of the track
hung there, things kept getting more and
more uncomfortabler. When construction
started up again&ndash;&ndash;the little Englishman, in
spite of the dose we give him, reported favorable
on construction and the English stockholders
put up the stake they was asked to&ndash;&ndash;things
got to be worse still. Right away, as
soon as work begun, the place was jammed
full of Greasers getting paid off every Saturday
night, and all day Sunday being crazy
drunk and knifing each other, and in between
scrappings having their pay sucked out of
&rsquo;em at the banks and dance-halls&ndash;&ndash;and most
of the boys going along about the same rate,
except they used guns instead of knives to
settle matters&ndash;&ndash;so the town really was just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
about what you might call a quarter-section
of hell&rsquo;s front yard.</p>
<p>Being that way, it come to be seen there&rsquo;d
got to be a clean-up; and what was wanted
for a starter was give by Santa F&eacute; Charley
shooting Bill Hart. There was no real use
for the shooting. The two of &rsquo;em just got
to jawing in Hart&rsquo;s store about which was
the best of two brands of plug tobacco&ndash;&ndash;Hart
being behind the counter, and Charley,
who had a bad jag on, setting out in the
middle of the store on a nail-kag&ndash;&ndash;and the
first thing anybody knowed, Charley&rsquo;d let
go with his derringer through his pants-pocket
and Hart was done for. If Santa F&eacute;
hadn&rsquo;t been on one of his tears at the time, the
thing wouldn&rsquo;t a-happened&ndash;&ndash;him and Hart
always having been friendly, and &rsquo;specially
so after the trouble they&rsquo;d had together over
Hart&rsquo;s aunt. But when it did happen&ndash;&ndash;being
so sort of needless, and Hart popular&ndash;&ndash;most
of us made our minds up something had
got to be done.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Joe Cherry headed the reform movement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
He had a bunch of sheep up in the Sangre de
Cristo mountains, Cherry had, but was in
town frequent and always bunked at Hart&rsquo;s
store&ndash;&ndash;him and Hart having knowed each
other back East and being great friends.
That made him take a &rsquo;special interest in the
matter; and when he come a-riding in about
an hour after things was over&ndash;&ndash;likely he&rsquo;d a-fixed
Santa F&eacute; himself if he&rsquo;d been there
when it happened&ndash;&ndash;he got right up on his ear.
He said he meant to square accounts for
Bill&rsquo;s shooting, and he reckoned telegraph-poling
Charley was about what was needed
to square &rsquo;em; and he said it was a good
time, with that for a starter, for rounding-up
and firing all the toughs there was in town.
The rest of us allowed Cherry&rsquo;s notions was
reasonable, and it was seen there&rsquo;d better be
no fooling over &rsquo;em; and so we went straight
on and had a meeting, with Cherry chairman,
and fixed up a Committee&ndash;&ndash;and the Committee
begun business by corralling Santa F&eacute;,
and then set to work and made out a list of
them that was to be fired.</p>
<p>There was about a dozen of &rsquo;em in the list;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and they was told&ndash;&ndash;the notice being posted
at the deepo&ndash;&ndash;they had twenty-four hours to
get out in; and it was added that them that
wasn&rsquo;t out in twenty-four hours would find
&rsquo;emselves landed on the dumps for keeps. A
few of &rsquo;em kicked a little&ndash;&ndash;saying it was a free
country, and they guessed they&rsquo;d a right to
be where they&rsquo;d a mind to. But when the
Committee said back it just was a free country,
and one of the freest things in it was
telegraph-poles&ndash;&ndash;as Santa F&eacute; Charley was
going to find out for certain, and as them that
was ordered to get up and get and didn&rsquo;t
would find out along with him&ndash;&ndash;even the
kickingest of &rsquo;em seen they&rsquo;d better just shut
their heads and andy along.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t till the Committee come to tackle
the Sage-Brush Hen there was any trouble&ndash;&ndash;and
then they found their drills was against
quartz! Two or three of Charley&rsquo;s worst
shootings was charged to the Hen, she being
&rsquo;special friends with him; and just because she
was such a good-natured obliging sort of a
woman, always wanting to please everybody,
she was at the roots of half the fights that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
started in&ndash;&ndash;so there&rsquo;d come to be what was
called the Hen&rsquo;s Lot out in the cemetery on
the mesa, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before. The
Committee put her in their list because they
knowed for a fact there was bound to be
ructions in Palomitas as long as she stayed
there; and so they found &rsquo;emselves in a deepish
hole when she said plump Palomitas suited
her, and she didn&rsquo;t mean to be fired. The
Hen knowed as well as they did she had a
cinch on &rsquo;em. If they didn&rsquo;t like her staying,
she said, they could yank her up to the next
telegraph-pole to Charley&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;and then she
asked &rsquo;em, kind of cool and cutting, if they
didn&rsquo;t think hanging a lady would give a nice
name to the town!</p>
<p>The Committee was in session in the waiting-room
at the deepo while the Hen was
doing her talking, and Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;with handcuffs
on, and tied to the express messenger&rsquo;s
safe&ndash;&ndash;was in the express office, with the door
open between. Everybody seen the Hen
was right, and hanging her would be ungentlemanly,
and nobody seemed to know
what they&rsquo;d better do. While they was all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
setting still and thinking, Santa F&eacute; spoke up
from the express office&ndash;&ndash;saying he had the
reputation of the town at heart as much as
anybody, and to make a real clean-up the
Hen ought to quit along with the others,
and if they&rsquo;d let him have five minutes
private talk with her he&rsquo;d fix things so she&rsquo;d
go.</p>
<p>The Committee didn&rsquo;t much believe Santa
F&eacute; could deliver the goods; but they seen it
would be a way out for &rsquo;em if he did&ndash;&ndash;and so
they agreed him and the Hen should have
their talk. To make it private, he was took
out and hitched fast to a freight-car laying on
the siding back of the deepo&ndash;&ndash;the Committee
standing around in easy shooting distance,
but far enough off not to hear nothing, with
their Winchesters handy in case the Hen took
it into her head to cut the rope and give him
a chance to get away. She didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;and she
and Santa F&eacute; talked to each other mighty
serious for a while; and then they begun to
snicker a little; and they ended up in a
rousing laugh.</p>
<p>Charley sung out they&rsquo;d finished, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Committee closed in and unhitched him,
and took him back to the express office and
hitched him to the safe again&ndash;&ndash;where he was
to stay till hanging-time, with members of
the Committee taking turns keeping him
quiet with their guns. He said he was much
obliged to &rsquo;em, and the Hen had agreed to
quit&ndash;&ndash;and everybody was pleased all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like not being here when Charley
gets his medicine,&rdquo; the Hen said, &ldquo;him and
me being such good friends; but he says it
would only worry him having me in the
audience, and so I&rsquo;ve promised him I&rsquo;ll light
out&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and she kept her word, and got away
for Denver by that night&rsquo;s train. Her going
took a real load off the Committee&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Some of the other fired ones went off on the
same train. The rest took Hill&rsquo;s coach across
to Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;and made no trouble, Hill said,
except they held the coach for two hours at
Pojuaque while all hands got drunk at old
man Bouquet&rsquo;s. Hill said all the rest of the
way they was yelling, and firing off their guns,
and raising hell generally&ndash;&ndash;that was the way
Hill put it&ndash;&ndash;but they didn&rsquo;t do no real harm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>It was Joe Cherry&rsquo;s notion that Santa F&eacute;
should be took along to Hart&rsquo;s funeral, and
not hung till everybody got back to town
again. Joe was a serious-minded man, and
he said the moral effect of running things
that way would pan out a lot richer than if
they just had a plain hanging before the
funeral got under way.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; kicked at that, at first; and a
good many of the boys felt he had a right
to. Santa F&eacute; said it was all in the game to
run him up to the telegraph-pole in front of
the deepo, the same as other folks; but no
committee had no right, he said, to make a
circus of him by packing him all round the
place after poor old Bill&ndash;&ndash;who always had
been plain in his tastes, and would have been
the last man in Palomitas to want that kind
of a fuss made over him&ndash;&ndash;and he didn&rsquo;t mean
to take a hand in no such fool carryings-on.
He didn&rsquo;t want anybody to think he was
squirming, he said, for he wasn&rsquo;t. Some men
got up against telegraph-poles, and others
got up against guns or pneumonia or whatever
happened to come along&ndash;&ndash;and it was all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
in the day&rsquo;s work. But when they did get
up against it&ndash;&ndash;whatever it turned out to be&ndash;&ndash;that
was the one time in their lives when it
wasn&rsquo;t fair to worry &rsquo;em more&rsquo;n was needed.
Nobody but chumps, he said, would want to
hurt his feelings by making him do trick-mule
acts at poor old Bill&rsquo;s funeral&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;specially as
him and Bill always had been friendly, and
nobody was sorrier than he was about the
accident that had occurred.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; was a first-rate talker, and everybody
but Cherry allowed what he was letting
out had a good deal of sense in it. He ended
up by saying that if they did make any such
fool show of him he&rsquo;d like &rsquo;em to put it
through quick and get him back to the deepo
and telegraph him off to Kingdom Come in a
hurry&ndash;&ndash;as he&rsquo;d be glad at any price to be shut
of a crowd that would play it on anybody
that low down!</p>
<p>Cherry stuck it out, though, to have things
his way. Palomitas was going in for purification,
Cherry said, and the moral effect of
having Santa F&eacute; along at Bill&rsquo;s funeral was
part of the purifying. The very fact that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Santa F&eacute; was kicking so hard against it, he
said, showed it was a good thing. There
was sense in that, too; and so the upshot of it
was the boys come round to Cherry&rsquo;s plan.
The only serious thing against it was it
meant waiting over another day, till the
funeral outfit got down from Denver&ndash;&ndash;all
hands having chipped in to give Hart a good
send-off, and telegraphed his size to a first-class
Denver undertaker, with orders to do
him up in style. Making him wait around
so long, sort of idle, was what Santa F&eacute;
kicked hardest against at first. But after
his talk with the Hen, as was remembered
afterwards, he didn&rsquo;t do any more kicking;
and some of the boys noticed he was a little
nervous, and kept asking, off and on, if they
still meant to run the show that way.</p>
<p>The boys did what they could to make the
time go for him&ndash;&ndash;setting around sociable in
the express office telling stories about other
hangings they&rsquo;d happened to get up against,
and trying all they knowed how to amuse
him, and giving him more seegars and drinks
than he really cared to have. But as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
was kept hitched to both handles of the safe
right enough, and handcuffed, and as the two
members of the Committee watching him&ndash;&ndash;while
they was as pleasant with him as anybody&ndash;&ndash;never
had their hands far off their
guns, it&rsquo;s likely there&rsquo;d been other times when
he&rsquo;d enjoyed himself more.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Things was spirited at the deepo when the
Denver train got in. All there was of Palomitas
was on deck, and Becker&rsquo;d come over from
Santa Cruz de la Ca&ntilde;ada, and old man
Bouquet from Pojuaque, and Sam and
Marcus Elbogen had driven across on their
buck-board from San Juan&ndash;&ndash;and Mexicans
had come in from all around in droves.</p>
<p>The Elbogen brothers had been asked over
for the funeral &rsquo;special&ndash;&ndash;because they both
had good voices, and the Committee thought
like enough, being Germans, they&rsquo;d know
some hymns. It turned out they didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;but
they blew off &ldquo;The Watch on the Rhine&rdquo;
in good shape, when singing time come out at
the cemetery; and as it was a serious-sounding
tune it done just as well. Singing it made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
trouble, though: because Hart&rsquo;s nephew&ndash;&ndash;who
knowed German and was a pill&ndash;&ndash;hadn&rsquo;t
no more sense&rsquo;n to tell old man Bouquet,
coming back to town, what the words meant;
and that started old man Bouquet off so&ndash;&ndash;the
war not being long over, and his side
downed&ndash;&ndash;that it took two of us, holding him
by his arms and legs, to keep him from trying
to fight both the Elbogens at once.
Being good-natured young fellows, the Elbogens
didn&rsquo;t take offence, but behaved like
perfect gentlemen&ndash;&ndash;telling old man Bouquet
they didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt his feelings, and
was sorry if they had&ndash;&ndash;and it ended up well
by their having drinks together at the Forest
Queen. All that, though, has no real bearing
on the story. It happened along later in the
day.</p>
<p>Before the train got in, to save time, a rope
had been rigged for Santa F&eacute; over the cross-bar
of the usual telegraph-pole&ndash;&ndash;and Cherry,
who knowed how to manage better&rsquo;n most,
had seen to it the rope was well soaped so as
to run smooth. Cherry said he&rsquo;d knowed
things go real annoying, sometimes, when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
soap had been forgot. Santa F&eacute; looked well.
He&rsquo;d had a good brush up&ndash;&ndash;and he needed it,
after being tied fast to the safe for three days
and sleeping in a blanket on the express-office
floor&ndash;&ndash;and he&rsquo;d put on a clean shirt,
and blacked his boots, and had a shave. He
always was a tidy sort of a man.</p>
<p>When the train pulled in, being on time for
a wonder, some fellows from Chamita and
the Embudo&ndash;&ndash;come to see the doings&ndash;&ndash;got
out from the day-coach and shook hands; and
the Denver undertaker got out from the express-car
and helped the messenger unload
the fixings he&rsquo;d brought for poor old Bill.
Everybody stood around quiet like, and as
serious as you please. You might have
thought it was a Sunday morning back in the
States.</p>
<p>Except now and then a drummer&ndash;&ndash;bound
for Santa F&eacute; on Hill&rsquo;s coach&ndash;&ndash;nobody much
ever come to Palomitas on the Pullman;
and so there was something of a stir-up when
the Pullman conductor helped a lady out of
the car&ndash;&ndash;landing her close to where Charley
in his clean shirt and handcuffs on was standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
between two members of the Committee
holding guns. She was a fine-shaped woman,
but looked oldish&ndash;&ndash;as well as you could see for
the veil she had on&ndash;&ndash;having a sad pale face
a good deal wrinkled and a bunch of gray hair.
She was dressed in measly old black clothes,
and had an old black shawl on, and looked
poor.</p>
<p>Getting out into that crowd of men seemed
to rattle her, and she didn&rsquo;t for a minute look
at nobody. It wasn&rsquo;t till she a&rsquo;most butted
into Charley she seen him&ndash;&ndash;and when she did
see him she let off a yell loud enough to give
points to a locomotive! And then she sort
of sobbed out: &ldquo;My husband!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and got
her arms around Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s neck and begun
to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! It&rsquo;s my wife!&rdquo; said Charley.
And if the members of the Committee hadn&rsquo;t
caught the two of &rsquo;em quick they&rsquo;d likely
tumbled down.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; was the first to get his wind back.
&ldquo;My poor darling!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To think that
you should have come to me at last&ndash;&ndash;and in
this awful hour!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean, Charley? Tell me,
what does it mean?&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>Santa F&eacute; snuggled her up to him&ndash;&ndash;as well
as he could with his hands handcuffed&ndash;&ndash;and
said back to her: &ldquo;It means, Mary, that in
less than two hours&rsquo; time I am to be hung!
In the heat of passion I have killed a man.
It was more than half an accident, as everybody
here knows&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and he looked over her
head at the boys as they all jammed in to
listen&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but that don&rsquo;t matter, so far as the
dreadful result is concerned. I loved the
man I shot like my own brother, and shooting
him in that chance way has about broken
my heart. But that don&rsquo;t count either. Justice
must be done, my darling. Stern justice
must be done. You have come just in time to
see your husband die!&rdquo; He was quiet for a
minute, with the woman all in a shake against
him&ndash;&ndash;and a kind of a snuffling went through
the crowd. Then he said, sort of choky:
&ldquo;Tell me, Mary, how are our dear little girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was too broke up to answer him. She
just kept on hugging him, and crying as hard
as she could cry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Santa F&eacute;, &ldquo;it is better
that this painful scene should end. Take my
poor wife from me, and let me pay the just penalty
of my accidental crime. Take her away,
please&ndash;&ndash;and hang me as quick as you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hang you, Charley! They
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she sung out&ndash;&ndash;and
she jerked away from him and got in front
of Cherry and pitched down on the deepo
platform on her knees. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hang him,
sir!&rdquo; she groaned out. &ldquo;Spare him to me,
and to our dear little girls who love him with
all their little hearts! Oh, sir, say that he
shall be saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, ma&rsquo;am, please,&rdquo; Cherry said,
looking as worried as he could look. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
no sort of a way for a lady to do! Please
get up right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Never!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Never till
you promise me that the life of my dear
husband shall be spared!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and she grabbed
Cherry round the knees and groaned dreadful.
He really was the most awkward-looking
man, with her holding onto his legs that
way, you ever seen!</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, ma&rsquo;am, <i>do</i> get up!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Having you like that for another minute&rsquo;ll
make me sick. I&rsquo;m not used to such goings-on&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
Cherry did what he could to work
loose his legs.</p>
<p>But she hung on so tight he couldn&rsquo;t shake
her, and kept saying, &ldquo;Save him! Save him!&rdquo;
and uttering groans.</p>
<p>Cherry wriggled his legs as much as he
could and looked around at the boys. They
all was badly broke up, and anybody could
see they was weakening. &ldquo;Shall we let up
on Santa F&eacute; this time?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I guess
it&rsquo;s true he didn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n half mean, being
drunk the way he was, to shoot Bill&ndash;&ndash;and it
makes things different, anyway, knowing he&rsquo;s
got kids and a wife. Bill himself would be
the first to allow that. Bill was as kind-hearted
a man as ever lived. Do please,
ma&rsquo;am, let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody spoke for a minute&ndash;&ndash;but it was
plain how the tide was setting&ndash;&ndash;and then
Santa F&eacute; himself chipped in. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you all know I&rsquo;ve faced this music
from the first without any squirming, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
even come into Joe Cherry&rsquo;s plan for making
me do circus stunts at the funeral for the
good of the town. I&rsquo;m ready to go through
the whole fool business right now, and come
back here when it&rsquo;s all over and be hung according
to contract&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save him! Save him!&rdquo; the woman sung
out; and she give such a jerk to Cherry&rsquo;s
legs it come close to spilling him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will say this much, gentlemen,&rdquo;
Santa F&eacute; went on: &ldquo;I am willing to ask for
the sake of my dear wife and helpless innocent
infants what I wouldn&rsquo;t be low down
enough to ask for myself&ndash;&ndash;and that is that
you call this game off. This dreadful experience
has changed me, gentlemen. It has
changed me right down to my toes. Being
as close to a telegraph-pole as I am now
makes a man want to turn over a new leaf
and behave&ndash;&ndash;as some of you like enough&rsquo;ll
find out for yourselves if you don&rsquo;t draw
cards from my awful example and brace up
all you know how. Give me another show,
gentlemen. That&rsquo;s what I ask for&ndash;&ndash;give me
another show. Let me go home with my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
angel wife to the dear old farm in Ohio, where
my aged mother and my sweet babes are
waiting for me. Like enough they&rsquo;re standing
out by the old well in the front yard looking
down the road for me now!&rdquo; Santa F&eacute;
gagged so he couldn&rsquo;t go on for a minute.
But he pulled himself together and finished
with his chest out and his chin up and speaking
firm. &ldquo;Let me go home, I say, to the
old farm and my dear ones&ndash;&ndash;and take a
fresh start at leading bravely the honest life
of an honest man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he lowered down his chin and took
his chest in and said, sort of soft and gentle:
&ldquo;Let go of Mr. Cherry&rsquo;s legs and come and
kiss me, my darling! And please wipe the
tears from my eyes&ndash;&ndash;with my poor shackled
hands I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman give Cherry&rsquo;s legs one more
rousing jerk, and said, sort of imploring:
&ldquo;Save him! Save him for his old mother&rsquo;s
sake, and for mine, and for the sake of our
little girls!&rdquo; Then she got up and wiped
away at Santa F&eacute;&rsquo;s eyes with her pocket-handkerchief,
and went to kissing him for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
all she was worth&ndash;&ndash;holding on to him tight
around the neck with both arms.</p>
<p>The boys was all as uncomfortable as they
could be&ndash;&ndash;except Cherry seemed to feel better
at getting his legs loose&ndash;&ndash;and some of &rsquo;em
fairly snuffled out loud. They stood around
looking at each other, and nobody said a
word. Then Santa F&eacute; kind of wrenched
loose from her kissing him and spoke up.
&ldquo;Which is it to be, gentlemen?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Is it the telegraph-pole&ndash;&ndash;or is it another
chance?&rdquo; The woman moaned fit to break
her heart.</p>
<p>The silence, except for her moaning, hung
on for a good minute. Then Hill broke it.
&ldquo;Oh, damn it all!&rdquo; said Hill&ndash;&ndash;it was Hill&rsquo;s
way to talk sort of careless&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Give him another
chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That settled things. In another minute
they had the handcuffs off of Santa F&eacute; and
all the boys was shaking hands with him.
And then they was asking to be introduced
to his wife&ndash;&ndash;she was all broke to bits, and
crying, and kept her veil down&ndash;&ndash;and shaking
hands with her too; and they ended off by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
giving Charley and his wife three cheers.
You never seen folks so pleased! The only
one out of it was the Denver undertaker&ndash;&ndash;who
couldn&rsquo;t be expected to feel like the
rest of us; and was in a hurry, anyway, to
put through his job so he could start back
home on the night train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come along with me in the coach,
Charley,&rdquo; Hill said&ndash;&ndash;Hill always was a friendly
sort of a fellow&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll jerk you over
to Santa F&eacute; in no time, and you can start
right off East by the 6.30 train. That&rsquo;ll be
quicker&rsquo;n going up to Pueblo, and it&rsquo;ll be
cheaper too. The ride across sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t cost
you a cent. If you and your lady come in
my coach, you come free. And I say, boys,&rdquo;
Hill went on, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s open a pot for them little
girls! Here&rsquo;s my hat, with ten dollars in it
for a warmer. I&rsquo;d make it more if I could&ndash;&ndash;and
nobody&rsquo;ll hurt my feelings by raising my
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All hands made a rush for Hill&rsquo;s hat&ndash;&ndash;and
when Hill handed it to that poor woman,
who had her pocket-handkerchief up to her
eyes under her veil and was crying so she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
shook all over, there was more&rsquo;n two hunderd
dollars in it, mostly gold. &ldquo;This is for
them children, ma&rsquo;am, with all our compliments,&rdquo;
Hill said&ndash;&ndash;and he and Charley helped
her hold her shawl up, so it made a kind of
a bag, while he turned his hat upside-down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking for my dear little girls, I thank
you from my heart, gentlemen,&rdquo; Santa F&eacute;
said. &ldquo;This is a royal gift, and it comes at a
mighty good time. Some part of it must be
used to pay our way East&ndash;&ndash;back to the dear
old home, where those little angels are waiting
for us sitting cuddled up on their grandmother&rsquo;s
knees. What remains, I promise
you gentlemen, shall be a sacred deposit&ndash;&ndash;to
be used in buying little dresses, and hats, and
things, for my sweet babes. I hate to use a
single cent of it for anything else, but the
fact is just now I&rsquo;m right down to the hardpan.&rdquo;
And everybody&ndash;&ndash;remembering Santa
F&eacute;&rsquo;d took advantage of being on his drunk
to get cleaned out at Denver Jones&rsquo;s place
the night before the shooting&ndash;&ndash;knowed this
was true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Charley, we must be andying along,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Hill said. &ldquo;Waiting here to see you hung
has put me more&rsquo;n an hour behind on my
schedule. I&rsquo;ll have to hustle them mules like
hell&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;that was the careless way Hill talked
always&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if we&rsquo;re going to ketch that 6.30
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody shook hands for good-bye with
Santa F&eacute; and his wife, and Santa F&eacute; had his
pockets stuffed full of seegars, and more
bottles was put in the coach than was needed&ndash;&ndash;and
then we give &rsquo;em three cheers again,
and away they went down the slope to the
bridge over the Rio Grande, with Hill whipping
away for all he was worth and cussing
terrible at his mules. Whipping done some
good, Hill used to say; but cuss-words was
the only sure things to make mules go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Cherry, when the yelling
let up a little. &ldquo;I guess getting shut of
Santa F&eacute; that way is better&rsquo;n hanging him;
and I guess&ndash;&ndash;with him and the Hen and the
rest of &rsquo;em fired out of it&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ve got Palomitas
purified about down to the ground. And
what&rsquo;s to all our credits, we&rsquo;ve ended off
by doing a first-class good deed! Them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
little girls&rsquo;ll be pleased and happy when
their mother gets back to &rsquo;em with our money
in her pocket, and brings along in good shape
their father&ndash;&ndash;who&rsquo;d just about be in the
thick of his kicking on that telegraph-pole,
by this time, if she hadn&rsquo;t romped in the
way she did on the closest kind of a close
call!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s turn to and get poor old
Bill planted. We&rsquo;ve kind of lost sight of
Bill in the excitement&ndash;&ndash;and we owe him a
good deal. If Santa F&eacute; hadn&rsquo;t started the
reform movement by shooting him, we&rsquo;d still
be going on in the same old way. You may
say it&rsquo;s all Bill&rsquo;s doings that Palomitas has
been give the clean-up it wanted, and wanted
bad!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Hill drove into town next afternoon&ndash;&ndash;coming
to the deepo, where most of the
boys was setting around waiting for the train
to pull out&ndash;&ndash;he was laughing so he was most
tumbling off the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the damnedest biggest joke on
this town,&rdquo; Hill said&ndash;&ndash;Hill had the habit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
talking that off-hand way&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that ever was
got on a town since towns begun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill was so full of it he couldn&rsquo;t hold in to
make a story. He just went right on blurting
it out: &ldquo;Do you boys know who that wife
of Charley&rsquo;s was that blew in yesterday from
Denver? I guess you don&rsquo;t! Well, I do&ndash;&ndash;she
was the Sage-Brush Hen! Yes sirree,&rdquo;
Hill said, so full of laugh he couldn&rsquo;t hardly
talk plain; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just who she was! All
along from the first there was something
about her shape I felt I ought to know, and I
was dead right. It come out while we was
stopping at Bouquet&rsquo;s place at Pojuaque for
dinner&ndash;&ndash;they both knowing I&rsquo;d see it was such
a joke I wouldn&rsquo;t spoil it by giving it away
too soon. She went in the back room at
Bouquet&rsquo;s to have a wash and a brush up&ndash;&ndash;and
when she come along to table she&rsquo;d
got over being Charley&rsquo;s wife and was the
Hen as good as you please! She hadn&rsquo;t a
gray hair or a wrinkle left nowhere, and was
like she always was except for her black
clothes. When she saw my looks at seeing
her, she got to laughing fit to kill herself&ndash;&ndash;just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
the same gay old Hen as ever; and she
always was, you know, the most comical-acting
sort of a woman, when she wanted
to be, anybody ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she quieted down her laughing a
little she told me the whole story. She and
Charley&rsquo;d fixed it up between &rsquo;em, she said;
and she&rsquo;d whipped up to Denver on one train
and down again on the next&ndash;&ndash;buying quick
her gray hair and her black outfit, and getting
somebody she knowed at the Denver theatre
to fix her face for her so she&rsquo;d look all broke
up and old. She nearly gave the whole thing
away, she said, when Charley asked her about
the little girls. He just throwed that in, without
her expecting it&ndash;&ndash;and it set her to laughing
and shaking so, back of her veil, that
we&rsquo;d a-ketched up with her sure, she said,
if Charley hadn&rsquo;t whispered quick to pretend
to cry and carry off her laughing that way.
She had another close call, she said, when
Charley was talking about the old farm in
Ohio&ndash;&ndash;she all the time knowing for a fact
he was born in East St. Louis, and hadn&rsquo;t
any better acquaintance with Ohio than three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
months in the Cincinnati jail. Charley
ought to go on the stage, she says&ndash;&ndash;where
she&rsquo;s been herself. She says he&rsquo;d lay Forrest
and Booth and all them fellows out cold!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and Charley just yelled while she was
telling it all to me; and they was laughing
&rsquo;emselves &rsquo;most sick all the rest of the way
across to Santa F&eacute;. When we got into town
I drove &rsquo;em to the Fonda; and then the Hen
rigged herself out in good clothes she bought
at Morse&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it was the pot we made up for
them sweet babes paid for her outfit&ndash;&ndash;and
give her old black duds to one of the Mexican
chambermaids. They allowed&ndash;&ndash;knowing I
could be trusted not to go around talking in
Santa F&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;d stay on at the Fonda till
to-morrow, anyway: so I might let &rsquo;em know,
when I get back again, how you boys took it
when you was told how they&rsquo;d played it on
you right smack down to the ground!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley sent word he hoped there wouldn&rsquo;t
be no hard feeling&ndash;&ndash;as there oughtn&rsquo;t to be,
he said, seeing he was so drunk when he shot
Bill it was just an accident not calling for
hanging; and the whole thing, anyways, being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
all among friends. And the Hen sent word
she guessed the two of &rsquo;em had give you a
first-class theatre show worth more&rsquo;n you
put in my hat for gate-money, and you all
ought to be pleased. And they both said
they&rsquo;d been treated so square by you fellows
they&rsquo;d be real sorry to have any misunderstanding,
and they hoped you&rsquo;d take the
joke friendly&ndash;&ndash;the same as they meant it
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Well, of course we all did take it friendly&ndash;&ndash;it
wouldn&rsquo;t a-been sensible to take as good a
joke as that was any other way. Cherry was
the only one that squirmed a little. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on
us, and it&rsquo;s on us good,&rdquo; Cherry said; &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m not kicking&ndash;&ndash;only you boys haven&rsquo;t got
no notion what it is having a woman a-grabbing
fast to your legs and groaning at
you, and how dead sick it makes you feel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cherry stopped for a minute, and looked as
if he was a&rsquo;most sick with just thinking about
it. Then he sort of shook himself and got a
brace on, and went ahead with his chin up
like he was making a speech in town-meeting&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
it turned out, as it don&rsquo;t always in
town-meeting speeches, what he said was
true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Cherry, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s this
to be said, and we have a right to say it
proudly: we&rsquo;ve give this town the clean-up
we set out to give it, and from now on it&rsquo;s
going to stay clean. There won&rsquo;t be any
more doings; or, if there is, the Committee
&rsquo;ll know the reason why. Palomitas is purified,
gentlemen, right down to the roots; and
I reckon I&rsquo;m mistook bad&ndash;&ndash;worse&rsquo;n I was
when the Hen was yanking my legs about&ndash;&ndash;if
the Committee hasn&rsquo;t sand enough and
rope enough to keep on keeping it pure!&rdquo;</p>
<p style='text-align:center; margin-top:2em;'>THE END</p>
